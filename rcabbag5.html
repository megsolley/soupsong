<H5>Very earthy, very sweet, this soup is lovely to eat, with thickly textured vegetables in a deeply flavored broth.  Many thanks to friends Pasaka and Jonas Griciai, of Lithuanian stock, for the contribution.  They say, "we like to serve this soup in the summer with barbeque ribs, but the beauty of it is that it really is as delicious in the winter and all other seasons.  Serve hot to 6-8 people as a first course.</H5>

In a large pot, heat the oil, then sweat the onion and garlic over low heat for about 3 minutes.  Add the bacon and cook til crisp.  Pour off excess fat, then stir in the mushrooms and cook over high heat for several minutes.  Pour in the two stocks, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.  Scrape in the cabbage and parsley, and simmer for 10 more minutes.  The cabbage should be cooked but not mushy.  Season to taste.

When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle each with a bit of minced parsley.
