<CENTER><H2><I>Thai Hot and Spicy Shrimp Soup</I></H2>
<H3>(Tom Yum Koong)</H3></CENTER>
<HR>
<H5>This Thai soup is wonderful--hot and sour and piquant, an outstanding combination of rich, chewy shrimp--slippery mushroom--and the foresty green of just cooked cilantro fronds in a complex broth.  Serve to 4, all at once with rice and any number of other dishes.  In a way, it serves as a beverage to the whole meal, served, as it traditionally is, all together.</H5>

</UL>
<P>
 Peel shrimp, reserving shells, and both devein and continue slicing lengthwise, pounding flat--then set aside.  Heat oil in a large saucepan, then fry the shrimp shells in it until they turn pink.  Pour in chicken stock and bring to a boil, then reduce and let simmer.  Cut the lemon grass stalks in pieces--reserving the bottom 5 inches--then bruise the pieces with a few heavy hits, then toss them into the soup.
<P>
Cut the reserved lemon grass into thin pieces, then either toss into a blender or pound with the garlic, the cilantro stems, the chilies, and and lime zest and leaves, and white pepper.  Stir into the soup, bring to a boil, then reduce and simmer for 20 minutes.
<P>
When the stock is done, pour through a sieve, return to the saucepan, and reheat.  When soup is at a boil, add shrimp and mushrooms and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the shrimp are pink.  Reduce heat, add lime juice and fish sauce, and taste for seasoning.  
<P>
When ready to serve, stir in slivered chilies and cilantro leaves, then ladle into bowls.
