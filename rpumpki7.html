No one will believe how incredibly easy and fast it is to make this very smooth and elegant soup.  It's very pure and tasty without the curry, but layered and sensational with it.  Many thanks to Janine Murdoch of Box Hill, Australia, for the recipe.  A recognized "soup-a-saurus" by her friends, Janine grew up with this soup.  She notes that, "although it's not a
"traditional aussie recipe" as such, it is very common
in Australia and always on a menu somewhere, as
pumpkins are almost (not quite) a staple, like
potatoes.  My mum just used to fry the onions then add
water and pumpkin (and sometimes curry).  I guess I
was lazy and just boiled the whole lot.  Then added my
own touches, such as chicken stock (instead of the
water) and fresh garlic for extra flavour" (as fresh garlic wasn't commonly found in her country stores when she was growing up).  Serve hot to 4-6 people as a lovely first course at dinner or with a sandwich or salad for lunch.

<P>
Heat the oil in a large saucepan, then stir in the onions and garlic and fry over medium heat until they are soft.  Stir in the curry, and keep stirring for about a minute.  Pour in the stock, add the pumpkin, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and let cook until the pumpkin is very tender, about 15-20 minutes.  Pur&#233;e in a blender, solids first, return to the pan, and season to taste.

When ready to serve, ladle into soup bowls, splash each with cream, and sprinkle with chives and parsley.
