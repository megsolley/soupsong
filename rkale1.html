Marge Whitmore of Leesburg, Virginia, recommends substituting andouille sausage for hard-to-find linguica and adding 2 15-ounce cans of drained and rinsed white kidney beans 5 minutes before adding the greens.</center></H5>

<H5>Delicate, beautiful, and restorative.  How do I know?  It was my 50th birthday soup:  after waking up to a pouring rain in Castelo da Vide, horribly sick from goat stew, daughter Meg and I made the long, twisting drive to Evora; at day's end, she insisted on buying me birthday dinner in our tiny hotel dining room. Caldo Verde--it was just what the doctor should have ordered.  Serve this recipe hot as a first course to 6 people.</H5>

<H5><CENTER>THE REAL THING</CENTER><BR>Maria do Carmo Torres of Lisboa, Portugal, has been kind enough to contribute the following recipe, in the true spirit of Caldo Verde being a soup of the people:
<UL>
<LI> Make a light broth with potatoes, as light as possible.
<LI> Take dark green cabbage, or kale--in Portugal called "couve galega"--roll the leaves tightly and sliced them as thinly as possible.  Scald briefly so they are brilliant green.  The cabbage should be abundant to give body to the broth.
<LI> When ready to serve, add the scalded cabbage to the broth with a little olive oil and let it boil for about 5 minutes, so the olive oil can cook.
<LI>  Serve with slices of the smallest Portuguese pork sausage you can find--each region in Portugal has its own, most of them spiced with paprika (colorau)
</UL>
Maria, who when not working loves to cook, listen to music and opera, go to the movies, and read (and who admits to being "owned" by a she-cat), says:  "this kind of soup is to be eaten in winter.  You can see that it serves as a poor peasants' food, with all ingredients coming from the kitchen garden.  Along with the caldo, you can also serve corn bread (broa).  Bom apetite--have a good meal!"

<CENTER>THE FANCY VERSION</CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>1 <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, minced fine
<LI>1 <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A> clove, minced
<LI>4 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>6 <A HREF="fpotato.html">potatoes</A>, peeled and sliced thin
<LI>2 quarts cold water
<LI>6 oz. dry, garlicky <A HREF="fmeat.html">sausage</A> (linguica, chorizo, even pepperoni), sliced  paper thin
<LI>2 and 1/2 teaspoons <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>1 lb.<A HREF="fcabbage.html"> collards, kale, or turnip greens</A>, washed, trimmed, rolled up and sliced into extra fine shreds (in a pinch, slightly defrost frozen kale and finely shred it with a sharp knife)
</UL>
In a large saucepan, saute the onion and garlic in 3 Tablespoons of oil for about 3 minutes.  Add the potatoes and saute, stirring constantly, for 2-3 minutes.  Add water, cover, and boil gently over medium heat for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are mushy.  Meanwhile, fry the sausage in a skillet over low heat for about 10 minutes, until most of the fat has drained out.  Drain well and reserve.
<P>
When the potatoes are soft, remove from the heat and either mash them in the pan with a masher or puree them--then add the sausage, salt, and pepper.  Return to medium heat, cover, and simmer for 5 more minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, add the shreds of greens and simmer uncovered for about 5 minutes--until they are tender and the color of jade.  Mix in the last Tablespoon of oil, taste for seasoning, and ladle into large flat soup plates.
