<HR>
<H5>A light, bright, and incredibly fresh-tasting broccoli soup, thick with melting cheddar cheese.  The secret is in the late addition of the tender florets.  Serve hot to 4 people as a first course--to 2 people as a satisfying meal.  </H5>

<UL>
<LI>3/4 pound of <A HREF="fbroccol.html">broccoli</A>, florets cut off and reserved, stems lightly peeled and chopped (woody end discarded)
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>

<LI>1 <A HREF="fpotato.html">potato</A>, peeled and diced
<LI>1/4 to 1/2 cup <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>, chopped
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpepper.html">pepper</A> to taste
</UL>
 
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  brick of <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheddar cheese</A>, for grating
<P>
In a large saucepan, saute the onion, broccoli stems, celery, and hot pepper in the olive oil over low heat--sweating them until the onion is transparent.  Pour in the stock and bring to a boil.  Stir in potato and parsley, then reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.  Puree, solids first, in a blender--then return to the pot.
<P>
When you're 5 or so minutes away from serving, bring the pureed soup to a boil, stir in the reserved florets, and cook on medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes.  Return the soup and florets to the blender and lightly pulse until the florets are nicely chunked and distributed throughout.
<P>
Ladle into soup bowls or flat soup plates and grate the cheese in long, thick strips over each serving.  Serve immediately.
