A farmer came from the country to sell his pears in the market.  they were juicy and fragrant, and his sales were booming, when a Taoist priest wearing tattered scarves and coarse cotton clothes appeared at the wagon and begged for some fruit.  The farmer shooed him away, but he refused to leave.  The farmer's voice rose until he was screaming and cursing.
<P>
"Your wagon holds hundreds of pears," said the priest, "and I ask for only one.  that's no great loss, sir; why get so angry?"
<P>
The crowd tried to persuade the farmer to part with a bruised pear and be rid of the man, but the farmer indignantly refused.  At last a market guard saw that the uproar was getting out of hand and put up a few coins for a piece of fruit to throw to the priest.
<P>
Hands clasped above his head, the priest thanked the guard.  Then he turned to the crowd and said, "We who have left the world find man's greed hard to understand.  Let me offer some choice pears to all you good customers."
<P>
"Now that you have your pear," someone said, "why don't you eat it yourself?"
<P>
"All I needed was a seed for planting," replied the priest.  And holding the fruit in both hands, he gobbled it up.  Then he took the little shovel that he carried on his back and dug several inches into the ground.  He placed the seed in the hole and covered it with earth.
<P>
The priest called for hot water, and a bystander with a taste for mischief fetched some from a nearby shop.  The priest poured the water over the seed he had planted.  Every eye was now on him.
<P>
Behold!  a tiny shoot appeared.  Steadily it increased in size until it became a full-grown tree, with twigs and leaves in unruly profusion.  In a flash it burst into bloom and then into fruit.  Masses of large, luscious pears filled its branches.
<P>
The priest turned to the tree, plucked the pears, and began presenting them to the onlookers.  In a short while the fruit was gone.  Then with his shovel the priest started to chop the tree.  "Teng! Teng!" the blows rang out in the air until finally the tree fell.  Taking the upper part of the tree onto his shoulders, the priest departed with a relaxed gait and untroubled air.
<P>
During all this the farmer had been part of the crowd, gaping with outstretched neck and forgetting his business.  But when the priest departed the farmer noticed that his wagon was empty.  And then the suspicion came to him that it was his own pears that had been presented to the crowd.  Looking more carefully, he saw that a handle had been chopped off the wagon.  In vexation, he searched until he found it lying discarded at the foot of a wall.  And now he realized that the pear tree he had seen cut down was the handle of his wagon.
<P>
Of the priest there was no sign at all, but the marketplace was in an uproar of laughter.
