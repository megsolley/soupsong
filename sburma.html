<H5><I>This is one of many tales created at a flashpoint in Burmese history:  when the British conquered the lower part of the country, circa 1876, and put the divided country in extreme fear that its national religion (Buddhism, since the 11th century) and its very way of life would be extinguished.  Politicized and thrown into confusion, the Buddhist clergy splintered, even in its relationship with King Mindon, but the great monk Thingazar Sayadaw--beginning as a child in the traditional way--sought to heal rifts and keep Buddha's truths alive through a literary genre he invented:  the Monk's Tale.  Quite distinct from Buddha's <I>Jatakas</I>, they are similar to traditional Burmese folk tales but deal rather directly with the immediate stresses and strains of his contemporary society.  They are full of wisdom, though playfully presented, and presage the inevitable absorption of Burma into the British empire.  For all these reasons, I tell the circumstances under which this and a few other food tales were told, as well as the tales themselves.</I></H5>
<HR>

<I> Prologue: One of the most devoted patrons of the Thingazar Sayadaw
was an extra assistant commissioner of Rangoon. He had been educated
 in an English school in Calcutta, and therefore he was not well versed
in the scriptures as were his counterparts in Upper Burma. However, he
 was a devout Buddhist and built a monastery and invited the great monk
 to reside in it during the latter's many visits to Rangoon. Often he was
 exhorted by the venerable monk to give more attention to the actual
 practice of the religion, such as keeping the sabbath on religious days.
 But the commissioner pleaded that under the British government those
 days were not holidays. The monk then suggested that he should treat
 Sundays as Buddhist sabbath days, but then the official pleaded that be-
 cause of his multifarious duties even Sundays were working days for
 him. Some years passed. The commissioner reached the age limit, and
 retired from the service of the British government on a pension. So, when
 the monk came again to Rangoon, he said, "Great layman, now you can
 keep the sabbath regularly." "Alas, my lord," replied the layman, ''I
 find that I cannot concentrate on religion, because my mind is never at
 rest, worrying about the welfare of my family." The learned monk smiled
 and remarked, "Great layman, you are like the Hungry Man from the
 Hills."</I>

 Once a Villager was making preparations to give a great feast
 and he invited, according to custom, all and sundry to take a share
 of his merit by helping in the building of a temporary hall of bamboo and thatch, in which alms would be offered to the monks. In
 response to the invitation, people from the neighboring villages
 came and took part, with skill and enthusiasm, in the building of
 the alms hall. Amidst the bustle and excitement, the Villager noticed a man from the hills who stood all alone watching the others
 doing the work, and with a sad expression on his face. So he went
 to him and asked kindly, "Man from the Hills, what ails you? Are
 sick, are you ill?" "Sir," the Man replied sadly, ''I want to work
 you as the others are doing, I want to gain merit, and I want to join in
 the feast. But to my utter regret, I cannot do so. Who can work
 on an empty stomach?" On hearing this explanation, the Villager
 rushed into his kitchen, brought out a bowl of <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>, a basin of
 <A HREF="iveg.html">vegetable soup</A>, and a dish of fried <A HREF="fmeat.html">chicken</A>, and offered them to
 the Man from the Hills. Then he resumed his work together with
 the others. After a brief interval of time he looked towards the
 Man from the Hills, and he was surprised to see that the Man was
 again standing and watching the happy throng of workers with the
 same sad expression on his face. Greatly concerned, the Villager
 rushed to the Man and inquired what was the matter now. "Sir,"
 the Man replied sadly, ''I want to work as the others are doing,
 I want to gain merit, and I want to join in the feast. But to my utter
 regret, I cannot do so. Who can work on a full stomach?"
