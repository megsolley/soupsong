<P>
<BR>
The rain drums down like red ants,<BR>
each bouncing off my window<BR>
These ants are in great pain<BR>
and they cry out as they hit,<BR>
as if their little legs were only<BR>
stitched on and their heads pasted.<BR>
And oh they bring to mind the grave,<BR>
so humble, so willing to be beat upon<BR>
with its awful lettering and<BR>
the body lying underneath<BR>
without an umbrella.
<P>
Depression is boring, I think,<BR>
and I would do better to make<BR>
some soup and light up the cave.
