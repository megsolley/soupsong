<H5>It's a main course, <A HREF="fbeans.html">often with internal consequences</A>--which, presumably, is one of the reasons that it's as American as can be. Serve hot to 2-3 people. </H5>

<H5>SoupTale:  Barometer Soup...by Mark Twain, <I>A Tramp Abroad</I><P>
<IMG height=250 width=250 SRC="einstein.gif" align="right">

"I know, by my scientific reading, that either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled, to make them accurate; I did not know which it was, so I boiled both.  There was still no result.<BR>
...I hunted up another barometer; it was new and perfect.  I boiled it half an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making.  The result was unexpected:  the instrument was not affected at all, but there was such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook, who was a most conscientious person, changed its name in the bill of fare.  This dish was so greatly liked by all, that I ordered the cook to have barometer soup every day."

<UL>
<LI>1/2 cup dried <A HREF="fbeans.html#white beans">common white beans</A>
<LI>a small piece of <A HREF="fmeat.html">salty ham</A>, ham bone, or bacon
<LI>4 cups boiling water
<LI>1 <A HREF="fbay.html">bay leaf</A>
<LI>1/4 teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">white peppercorns</A>
<LI>3 whole <A HREF="fclove.html">cloves</A>
<LI>1 <A HREF="fcarrot.html">carrot</A>, diced

</UL>
<BR>
Soak the beans overnight, then discard water.  Put beans, ham/bacon, boiling water, bay leaf, pepper, and cloves in a pot and cook slowly until the beans are soft, about 2-3 hours.  Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and grated potato and cook 30 more minutes.
<P>
Remove the meat and shred.  Put the soup through a food mill or processor.  Thin, if you like, with water or milk.  Correct seasoning.  Ladle into bowls and top with croutons and parsley.</h5>
