<H5>It's a hearty first course soup and tasting distinctively subcontinent Indian, except for the bacon....  Of course it's easy enough to substitute olive oil for a delicious vegetarian soup.  And as for the chutney, there's a lot of varieties on the market these days, but I agree with Doreen Leach from Morgan, New Jersey:  she notes that hot mango chutney gives the soup just the heat it needs.  Serve hot to 4-6 people.</H5>

</UL>
<P>
Fry bacon til crisp, then remove, drain, and reserve.  Pour off all but about 3 Tablespoons of the bacon fat and scrape up the bottom of the pan a bit, then add onion, garlic, curry, and cayenne and stir for about a minute.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for about 15 minutes, til the onions are soft.  Add the sugar, turn up the heat to high, and stir until the onions are brown--about 5 minutes.  Stir in the flour and set aside.
<P>
At the same time, bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan and add the potato and a teaspoon of salt.  Cover, reduce heat, and cook for 10 minutes.  Add the cauliflower and turmeric, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover, cooking until the vegetables are very tender, about 10 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool a minute or two.
<P>
Puree 3/4 of the cauliflower mixture with the chutney, then pour back into the pan with the remaining cauliflower mixture.  Stir in the onion mixture and bring to a simmer.  Simmer for 10 minutes.  At this point, you can hold it in the refrigerator til you are ready to serve it.  Just reheat when you're ready.
<P>
When ready to serve, stir in the crumbled bacon, parsley, lemon juice, and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the green onions.  Serve immediately.
