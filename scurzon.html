As a sidenote, please recall that in his day Lord Curzon was considered the arbiter of taste.  True story:  when a Steward of Balliol College, Oxford, suggested that a lunch for Queen Mary begin with Brown Windsor Soup, Lord Curzon returned the draft menu with the note:  "Gentlemen do not take soup at luncheon."<BR>--Simon Heffer, Daily Mail</H5></CENTER>

<P>
The story goes that British statesman George Nathaniel Curzon, then Viceroy of India, ordered a great dinner to be prepared in honor of a guest who happened not to be able to drink alcohol.  This was in 1905.
<P>
Lady Curzon, his American-born wife, was in a terrible position.  She had to respect the habits of her guest of honor.  However, the rest of the party was made up of Englishmen--and no civilized Englishman would dine without some form of libation.
<P>
In the end, Lady Curzon resolved her dilemma by ordering the chef to put sherry in the turtle soup, an elegant first course made of <A HREF="fturtle.html">now-protected species of sea turtles</A>.  Thus, for so long as this turtle soup is served anywhere in the world (and while it is no longer legal in the United States, it remains a standard on German menus), Lady Curzon's Soup will regally set the tone for elegant courses to follow.
<P>
For the record, here's the recipe:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>2 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg yolks</A>
<LI>1/3 cup <A HREF="bthicken.html#cream">heavy cream</A>
<LI>1/2 teaspoon (or more) <A HREF="fcurry.html">curry powder</A>
<LI>4 cups canned turtle soup, with <A HREF="fturtle.html">sea turtle</A> meat
<LI>1/4 cup <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sherry</A>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  6 Tablespoons <A HREF="bthicken.html#cream">heavy cream</A>, lightly whipped
<P>
In a bowl, whip together the egg yolks, cream, and curry powder.  In a large saucepan, bring the turtle soup to a boil, then gradually beat a cup of it into the egg yolk mixture, making a liaison.  Remove the turtle soup from the heat and finish the liaison by stirring in the egg mixture.  Add the sherry, then reheat at a very low temperature until light and creamy (it will not thicken).
<P>
To serve, pour into hot cups and float a Tablespoon of the whipped cream on each one.  Run the blowls under a hot broiler for just a few seconds, to glaze the cream, then serve immediately and triumphantly to 6 people.

<H5><BLOCKQUOTE>"The sign said 'The Green Turtle, <I>Chelonia myadas</I>, is the source of turtle soup...."  I am the source of William G. soup if it comes to that.  Everyone is the source of his or her kind of soup. In a town as big as London, that's a lot of soup walking around."  --Russell Hoban, <I>Turtle Diary</I>, chapter 3</BLOCKQUOTE></H5>
