<H3>Sack (Sherry)</H3>
<HR>
<U>Henry VI, part 2, II, 3</U>:<BR>
FIRST NEIGHBOR:  Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of
        <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>: and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.
<P>
<U>King Henry IV, part 1, I, 2</U>:<BR>
PRINCE HENRY:    Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>
        and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
        benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
        demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
        What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
        day? Unless hours were cups of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> and minutes
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">capons</A> and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
        signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
        a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
        reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
        the time of the day.
<P>
FALSTAFF:        A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
        marry, and amen! Give me a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>, boy. Ere I
        lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
        them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
        Give me a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>, rogue. Is there no virtue extant? (II, 4)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        You rogue, here's lime in this <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> too: there is
        nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
        yet a coward is worse than a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> with lime
        in it. (II, 4)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
        thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
        could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
        enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
        back: call you that backing of your friends? A
        plague upon such backing! give me them that will
        face me. Give me a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>: I am a rogue, if I
        drunk to-day. (II, 4)
<P>
PRINCE HENRY:    O villain, thou stolest a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> eighteen years
        ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
        thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
        sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
        instinct hadst thou for it? (II, 4)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
        now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> to
        make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
        wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
        in King Cambyses' vein.
<P>
PRINCE HENRY:  ...Wherein is he good, but to taste <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> and
        drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">capon</A> and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
        wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
        but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing? (II, 4)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
        were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
        more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
        that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
        that I utterly deny. If <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> and sugar be a fault,
        God help the wicked! (II, 4)
<P>
PETO:    [Reads]  Item, A <A HREF="fmeat.html">capon</A>,. . 2s. 2d.
        Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
        Item, <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">Sack</A>, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
        Item, Anchovies and <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> after supper, 2s. 6d.
        Item, Bread,        ob.
<P>
PRINCE HENRY:    O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
        this intolerable deal of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>! (II, 4)
<P>
FALSTAFF:  ...but the <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sac</A>k that thou hast
        drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
        at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
        maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
        time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
        it! (III, 3)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
        bottle of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>: our soldiers shall march through;
        we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight. (IV, 2)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
        rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
        I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>, and
        live cleanly as a nobleman should do. (V. 4)
<P>
<U>King Henry IV, part 2, I, 2</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF:  For the box of the ear that
        the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
        and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
        chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
        marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
        and old <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>.
<P>
FALSTAFF:        I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than
        your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-
        blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
        him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">wine</A>.
        There's never none of these demure boys come to any
        proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
        and making many <A HREF="ffish.html">fish-meals</A>, that they fall into a
        kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
        marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
        and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
        inflammation. A good <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sherris sack</A> hath a two-fold
        operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
        dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
        vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
        quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
        delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the
        voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
        excellent wit. The second property of your
        excellent <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sherris</A> is, the warming of the blood;
        which, before cold and settled, left the liver
        white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
        and cowardice; but the <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sherris</A> warms it and makes
        it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
        it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
        warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
        man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
        inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
        the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
        retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
        comes of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sherris</A>. So that skill in the weapon is
        nothing without <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>, for that sets it a-work; and
        learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
        <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> commences it and sets it in act and use.
        Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
        the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
        father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
        manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
        endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
        <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sherris</A>, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
        I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
        would teach them should be, to forswear thin
        potations and to addict themselves to <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>. (IV, 3)
<P>
SHALLOW:   A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,
        Sir John: by the mass, I have drunk too much <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>
        at supper: a good varlet. Now sit down, now sit
        down: come, cousin. (V, 3)
<P>
<U>King Henry V, II, 3</U>:<BR>
NYM (on Falstaff's death):     They say he cried out of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>.
<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, Prologue, 2</U>:<BR>
FIRST SERVANT:   Will't please your lordship drink a cup of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>?<BR>
SLY:     I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
        'lordship:' I ne'er drank <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> in my life; and if
        you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">beef</A>....
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, II, 1</U>:<BR>
MISTRESS PAGE:   What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
        time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
        Let me see.  [Reads]
        'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
        Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
        not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
        am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
        so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
        love <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>, and so do I; would you desire better
        sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
        the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
        that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis
        not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
        Thine own true knight,
        By day or night,
        Or any kind of light,
        With all his might
        For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'
<P>
FORD:    None, I protest: but I'll give you a <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">pottle of
        burnt sack</A> to give me recourse to him and tell him
        my name is Brook; only for a jest.
<P>
BARDOLPH:        Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
        speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
        sent your worship a morning's draught of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>. (II, 2)
<P>
HOST:  Boys of art, I have
        deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
        places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
        whole, and let <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">burnt sack</A> be the issue. Come, lay
        their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
        follow, follow, follow.
<P>
FALSTAFF:        Go fetch me a <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">quart of sack</A>; put a toast in't. (III, 5)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        Let me pour in some <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> to the Thames water; for my
        belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
        pills to cool the reins. Call her in. (III, 5)
<P>
FALSTAFF:        Take away these chalices. Go brew me a <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">pottle of
        sack</A> finely. (III, 5)
<P>
SIR HUGH EVANS:    And given to fornications, and to taverns and <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>
        and <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">wine</A> and <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">metheglins</A>, and to drinkings and
        swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles? (V, 5)
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, II, 3</U>:<BR>
SIR TOBY BELCH:  Come, come, I'll go burn some <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>; 'tis too late
        to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
<P>
<U>The Tempest, II, 2</U>:<BR>
STEPHANO:        How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
        swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
        escaped upon a <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">butt of sack</A> which the sailors
        heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
        the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
        cast ashore.
<P>
STEPHANO:        My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A>:
        for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
        could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
        and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
        monster, or my standard. (III, 2)
<P>
TRINCULO:        Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
        justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
        was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
        <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
        being but half a fish and half a monster? (III, 2)
<P>
TRINCULO:       I did not give the lie. Out o' your
        wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
        this can <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">sack</A> and drinking do. A murrain on
        your monster, and the devil take your fingers! (III, 2)

<U>Comedy of Errors, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS:      You minion, you, are these your customers?
        Did this companion with the <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> face
        Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
        Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
        And I denied to enter in my house?
<P>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, IV, 5 </U>:<BR>
LAFEU:   No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
        fellow there, whose villanous <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> would have
        made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
        his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
        this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
        by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
CLOWN:   I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
        I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
        of sugar, five pound of <A HREF="bflavor.html">currants</A>, <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>,--what will
        this sister of mine do with <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>? But my father
        hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
        on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
        the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
        ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
        one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
        horn-pipes. I must have <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> to colour the warden
        pies; <A HREF="fmace.html">mace</A>; <A HREF="bflavor.html">dates</A>?--none, that's out of my note;
        <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmegs</A>, seven; a race or two of <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>, but that I
        may beg; four pound of <A HREF="fplums.html">prunes</A>, and as many of
        <A HREF="bflavor.html">raisins</A> o' the sun.
<P>
<U>The Tempest, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
CERES:   Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
        Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
        Who with thy <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> wings upon my flowers
        Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
        And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
        My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
        Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
        Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?

CLOWN:    Indeed, sir, she was the <A HREF="fmarjora.html">sweet marjoram</A> of the

<P>

CLEOPATRA:       My <A HREF="fgreens.html">salad</A> days,

LAUNCE:  More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The

        is more than the <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>; the hair that covers the wit

HOTSPUR My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
        But I remember, when the fight was done,
        When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
        Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
        Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
        Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
        Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
        He was perfumed like a milliner;
        And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
        A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
        He gave his nose and took't away again;
        Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
        Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
        And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
        He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
        To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
        Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
        With many holiday and lady terms
        He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
        My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
        I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
        To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
        Out of my grief and my impatience,
        Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
        He should or he should not; for he made me mad
        To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
        And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
        Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
        And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
        Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
        And that it was great pity, so it was,
        This villanous <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt-petre</A> should be digg'd
        Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
        Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
        So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
        He would himself have been a soldier.
