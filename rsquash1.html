<H4>(That is, "Smells Like Butternut Squash, Apple And Pear Soup" from Dick and DeeDee's <I>Rock & Roll Cookbook</I> (1993))</H4></CENTER>

<H5>Here's what the late Kurt Cobain had to say about the genesis of the Seattle Sound:  "What people don't realize is that the so-called Seattle Grunge scene grew out of several close-knit gourmet supper clubs--we would only pick up guitars to pass the time while our dishes were simmering, baking, boiling, etc."  O that crazy cut-up.  Anyway, he had a nice soup to leave for posterity.  Put down the guitars and serve hot to 8 people as a hearty first course to Whatever.</H5>

<P>
 Melt butter in a Dutch oven over a low flame.  Saute the onions, squash, apples, and pear until tender, about 15-20 minutes.  Add stock and tarragon--then salt and pepper to taste.  Bring the whole concoction to a boil then cover and simmer over a low flame until the squash and apples are fully cooked (about 10 minutes).  Remove from heat and puree, solids first and in batches.  Stir in the cream and the vermouth.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  When ready to serve, reheat, ladle into bowls and serve hot with a dollop of sour cream topped with chopped chives.
