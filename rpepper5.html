<H5>Thick and earthy and gorgeously burnt orange, this is a beautiful, refreshing, and satisfying soup.  It has the taste of roasted red peppers times a thousand, without the work of roasting off the skins.  And it has a real bang at the finish from the cayenne.  Thanks to good friend Judy Irons for this great addition.  Serve cold as a substantial first course to 4-6 people. </H5>

In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium high heat, toss in the peppers and leeks and saute for a few minutes, then reduce heat and continue cooking until tender, about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Pour in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
<P>
When the vegetables are very tender, puree the soup in a blender, solids first.  Return to the saucepan and cook at a low simmer for about 30 more minutes.
<P>
Pour in the buttermilk and season immediately with cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper to taste.  Remember that you should overseason a little bit for cold soups.  Chill at least 3 hours, preferably overnight.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with chives.
