<HR>
<H5>Such a soft shade of pink, and so pretty with the mounds of whipped cream drifting across the surface.  It's a wonderful last course, serving as a delicate and refreshing palate cleanser after a rich dinner...right before you retire to the parlor and bring on buttery pastries and coffee.  Serve cold to 6 in flat soup plates to heighten the effect of the puffs of whipped cream. </H5>

Let cool, then cover and let chill.
