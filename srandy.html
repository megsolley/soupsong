My grandpa Solomon was an interesting guy.  In addition to being a gruff salty seadog who had traveled around the world many times as a ship's engineer in the Merchant Marines, he was also a Jew born and raised in Brooklyn.  Anyway, this is the soup story he told me.  
<P>
He was in the navy stationed overseas in Japan following World War II for a few years.  When he was sent back to the US, he offered his Japanese servant/cook a job if she wanted to move with him to his next job in Texas.  She accepted and fit in nicely in their new home.  
<P>
During one of his frequent trips back to Brooklyn, he allowed a couple of Texan friends to stay over at his home, which was perched nicely on the waterfront.  When Grandpa
returned after a week, his house guests were raving about the cook and the wonderful exotic Japanese soup they had been served all week. "What is it?" they enquired. 
<P>
After, a quick exchange with the cook he replied, "It's matzo ball soup, and she still doesn't get it right."
