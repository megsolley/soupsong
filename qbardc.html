<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, I, 1</U>:<BR>
SLENDER:  <I>Pauca verba,</I> sir John.  Goot words.<BR>
FALSTAFF:  Good worts!  Good cabbage.  Slender, I broke your head.  What matter have you against me?

<U>Henry IV, part 1, III, 1</U>:<BR>

HOTSPUR:     O, he is as tedious
        As a tired horse, a railing wife;
        Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
        With <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A> and <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A> in a windmill, far,
        Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
        In any summer-house in Christendom.
<P>
<U>Henry IV, part 2, III, 2</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF (about Justice Shallow):  I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a
        man made after supper of a <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>-paring: when a'
        was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
        radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
        with a knife.
<P>
<U>Henry V, II, 1</U>:<BR>
NYM:   For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
        time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
        shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
        wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
        what though? it will toast <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>, and it will
        endure cold as another man's sword will: and
        there's an end.
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, I, 1</U>:<BR>
BARDOLPH:    You Banbury <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>!
<P>
SIR HUGH EVANS:  Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
        is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
        Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
        and require her to solicit your master's desires to
        Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
        make an end of my dinner; there's <A HREF="fapple.html">pippins</A> and <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A> to come. (I, 2)
<P>
NYM (to Page):  My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis
        true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.
        Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>,
        and there's the humour of it. Adieu. (II, 1)
<P>
FORD:  Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
        will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
        rather trust a Fleming with my <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>, Parson Hugh
        the Welshman with my <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>, an Irishman with my
        aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
        gelding, than my wife with herself. (II, 2)
<P>
FALSTAFF:   Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
        transform me to a piece of <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>! (V, 5)
<P>
FALSTAFF:      Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
        it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
        this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
        have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
        with a piece of toasted <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>. (V, 5)
<P>
<U>Troilus and Cressida</U>:<BR>
ACHILLES:        Where, where? Art thou come? why, my <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>, my
        digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
        my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon? (II, 3)
<P>
THERSITES:  O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
        swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
        <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
        not proved worthy a <A HREF="fberry.html">blackberry</A>: they set me up, in
        policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
        as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
        prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
        to-day. (V, 4)
<P>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, I, 1</U>:<BR>
PAROLLES:  There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
        rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
        is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
        disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
        virginity murders itself and should be buried in
        highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
        offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
        much like a <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A>; consumes itself to the very
        paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
        Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
        self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
        canon. Keep it not.  
<P>
<U>King Lear, IV, 6</U>:<BR>
KING LEAR:   Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
        press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
        crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
        look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
        <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A> will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
        it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
        flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
        Give the word.

<U>As You Like It, V, 3</U>:<BR>
SECOND PAGE (singing):  It was a lover and his lass, <BR>
     With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, <BR>
 That o’er the green corn-field did pass, <BR>
     In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,<BR> 
 When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding; <BR>
 Sweet lovers love the spring. 
<P>
<U>Coriolanus, I, 1</U>:<BR>
FIRST CITIZEN:  First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people. <BR>  
ALL:  We know’t, we know’t.    <BR>
FIRST CITIZEN:  Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price. Is’t a verdict? 
<P>
<U>Coriolanus, II, 3</U>:<BR>
THIRD CITIZEN:  We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds, and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of the which, we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.<BR>
FIRST CITIZEN:  And to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude. 
<P>
<U>Henry IV, part 2, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
MOWBRAY: Yea, but our valuation shall be such <BR>  
That every slight and false-derived cause,   <BR>
Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason <BR>
Shall to the king taste of this action;   <BR>
That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,   <BR>
We shall be winnow’d with so rough a wind   <BR>
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff  <BR> 
And good from bad find no partition. 
<P> 
<U>Henry VI, part 1, III, 2</U>:<BR>
JOAN:   These are the city gates, the gates of Roan, <BR>  
Through which our policy must make a breach:   <BR>
Take heed, be wary how you place your words;   <BR>
Talk like the vulgar sort of market-men   <BR>
That come to gather money for their corn. 
<P> 
<U>Henry VI, part 2, I, 2</U>:<BR>
DUCHESS:   Why droops my lord, like over-ripen’d corn<BR>   
Hanging the head at Ceres’ plenteous load? 
<P>
<U>Henry VI, part 2, III, 2</U>:<BR>
WARWICK (about Gloucester):  His well-proportion’d beard made rough and rugged,<BR>
Like to the summer’s corn by tempest lodg’d.<BR> 
It cannot be but he was murder’d here;   <BR>
The least of all these signs were probable. 
<P>
<U>Henry VI, part 3, V, 7</U>:<BR>
KING EDWARD:  Once more we sit in England’s royal throne,<BR>   
Re-purchas’d with the blood of enemies.<BR>
What valiant foemen like to autumn’s corn,<BR>
Have we mow’d down, in tops of all their pride!<BR>
<P>
<U>King Henry VIII, V, 5:</U><BR>
CRANMER (about Princess Elizabeth):  Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,<BR>   
And hang their heads with sorrow;  
<P>
<U>King Henry VIII, V, 1</U>:<BR>
CRANMER [Kneeling]: I humbly thank your highness;   <BR>
And am right glad to catch this good occasion<BR>
Most throughly to be winnow’d, where my chaff<BR>   
And corn shall fly asunder 
<P>
<U>King Lear, III, 6</U>:<BR>
 EDGAR:Let us deal justly.<BR>
   Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd? <BR>
   Thy sheep be in the corn; <BR>
 And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,<BR> 
   Thy sheep shall take no harm. 
 <P>
<U>King Lear, IV, 6</U>:<BR>
CORDELIA:  Alack! ’tis he: why, he was met even now<BR>
As mad as the vex’d sea; singing aloud;<BR>
Crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds, <BR>  
With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,  <BR> 
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow   <BR>
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;<BR> 
Search every acre in the high-grown field,   <BR>
And bring him to our eye.  
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, I, 1</U>:<BR>
LONGAVILLE (about the King):  He weeds the corn, and still lets grow the weeding.
<P>
<U>Measure for Measure, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
DUKE:  Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all. <BR>
He is your husband on a pre-contract: <BR>  
To bring you thus together, ’tis no sin,   <BR>
Sith that the justice of your title to him   <BR>
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go: <BR> 
Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow.   
 <P>
<U>Pericles, III, 3</U>:
CLEON:  Fear not, my lord, but think<BR>
Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn<BR>   
For which the people’s prayers still fall upon you<BR> 
Must in your child be thought on. 
<P>
<U>Richard II, III, 2</U>:<BR>
KING RICHARD:  ...Aumerle, thou weep’st, my tender-hearted cousin!  <BR> 
We’ll make foul weather with despised tears;   <BR>
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,  <BR> 
And make a dearth in this revolting land. 
<P>
<U>The Tempest, II, 1</U>:<BR>
GONZALO:  I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries<BR>
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic   <BR>
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;   <BR>
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,<BR>   
And use of service, none; contract, succession,  <BR> 
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;   <BR>
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;   <BR>
No occupation; all men idle, all;   <BR>
And women too, but innocent and pure;<BR> 
No sovereignty,--
<P>
<U>Titus Andronicus, II, 3</U>:<BR>
DEMETRIUS:   Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her:   
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw. 
 <P>
<U>Titus Andronicus, V, 3</U>:<BR>
MARCUS: You sad-fac’d men, people and sons of Rome,<BR>   
By uproar sever’d, like a flight of fowl <BR>
Scatter’d by winds and high tempestuous gusts,<BR>   
O! let me teach you how to knit again <BR>
This scatter’d corn into one mutual sheaf....
<P>
