<HR>
<H5>There's been speculation that this first made news after President Reagan innocently announced his liking for fancy French soups...and was immediately accused of being elitist.  Whatever.  It's definitely a homespun, plain soup, and not as bad as you might think when you see that there's hominy in it.  This corn product--with an Algonquin Native American name--was an important food to early U.S. pioneers.  It's a nice firm little ball in the soup--almost dumpling like.  Serve the soup as a lunch meal to 4-6 people with lots of cornbread, cold milk, and maybe a big American pie for dessert.  Here's the recipe verbatim--note the non-elitist allowance for canned foods and bouillon cubes.</H5>
