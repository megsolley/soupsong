<HR>

A member of the ginger family, this knobby root hails from Indonesia and tastes like a cross between pepper and ginger. It's name is taken from the Arabic <I>khalanjan</I>, meaning "mild ginger." When the plants--which grow 3-4 foot flower stems--are several years old, they are lifted...and their roots removed and dried in the sun to a reddish-brown color.  These are then cut into 3-inch by 1-inch pieces.
<P>
Arabs grind these root pieces and take them as snuff.  They also use them to flavor wine and beer.  Hindus use them in their perfumes and to prepare curries.
<P>
The "lesser" galangal--<I>Alpinia officinarum</I> is native to South 
China and has been mentioned in ancient manuscripts of both China and India.
