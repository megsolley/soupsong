<HR>
<H5>A superb Christmas eve dinner tradition, this elegant soup is nicely tart, light and lightly spiced, just the perfect amount of heady and festive to lead off a Christmas dinner.  Serve hot to 4 people as a first course--and not just at Christmas.  It's a marvelous start to any special meal. </H5>
<HR>
<UL>
<H5><LI>3½ cups good quality dry white <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">wine</A> (Hungarian Hárslevelü is traditional)
<LI>¾ cup water
<LI>½ cup granulated <A HREF="fsugar.html">sugar</A>
<LI>1 small <A HREF="fcinnamo.html">cinnamon stick</A>
<LI>4 <A HREF="fclove.html">cloves</A>
<LI>4 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg yolks</A>
</UL>
<P>
Pour 3 cups of the wine and the water into a saucepan with the sugar, cloves, and cinnamon and bring to a boil.  While the soup is heating, beat the egg yolks with the remaining wine until creamy.  When the soup is at a boil, dip a cup of it, little by little, into the egg yolk mixture, beating constantly so the egg yolks don't curdle.  Incorporate another cup of the hot liquid into the eggs, then beat the eggs into the remaining soup.  Stir constantly while reheating and let the soup thicken a bit, then strain. Ladle into small elegant bowls, and serve immediately.</H5>
