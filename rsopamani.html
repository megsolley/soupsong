<HR>
<H5>This is the favorite soup of Gladys Rojas, who came to America from Bolivia and has made her dreams come true as a massage therapist.  I met her at Perfect Endings in my hometown of Falls Church, Virginia; it's Gladys who has worked out all manner of harm I've done myself snowshoeing, skiing, moving furniture, and just plain typing--for which I am eternally grateful.  I'm also grateful for this recipe, traditional in Bolivia especially for birthdays and holidays--calling for the finest beef stock as a base.  Gladys says she prefers eating to cooking, but she loves to cook this soup because it looks very nice and takes a long time to cook as a family project that all family members enjoy. It's a beauty: creamy and delicate with a kick.  The carrots are unbelievably sweet in this dish.  Serve it hot to 4 people as a first course to a party meal. </H5>
