You will end up puppy soup if you're born a pure white dog on the reservation, unless you're one who is extra clever, like me.  I survived into my old age through dog magic.  That's right.  You see me, you see the result of dog wit.  Dog skill.  Medicine ways I learned from my elders, and want to pass on now to my relatives.  You.  So listen up, animoshug.  You're only going to get this knowledge from the real dog's mouth once.
<P>
There is a little of a coyote in me, just a touch here in my paws, bigger than a dog's paws.  My jaw, too, strong to snap rabbit bones.  Prairie-dog bones as well. Prairie.  I don't mind saying to you that I'm not a full-blood Ojibwa reservation dog.  I'm part Dakota, born out in Bwaanakeeng, transported here.  I still remember all that sky, all that pure space, all that blowing dirt of land where I got my name, which has since become legendary.
<P>
Here's how it happened.
<P>
I was underneath the house one hot slow day panting in the dirt.  I was a young thing.  Just chubby, too, and like I said white all over.  That worried my mother.  Every morning she scratched dirt on me, threw me in the mud, rolled me in garbage to disguise my purity.  Her words to me were this--My don, you won't survive if you lick you paws.  Don't be respectable.  Us Indian dogs have got to look as unappetizing as we can!  Slink a little, won't you?  Stick your ears out.  Grow ticks.  Fleas.  Bite your fur here and there.  Strive for a disreputable appearance, my boy.  Above all, don't be clean!
<P>
Like I say, born pure white you usually don't stand a chance, but me, I took my mama's advice.  After all, I was the son of a blend of dogs stretching back to the beginning of time on this continent.  We sprang up here.  We had no need to cross on any land bridge.  We know who we are.  Us, we are descended of Original Dog.
<P>
I think about her lots, and also about my ancestor, from way way back, the dog named Sorrow who drank a human's milk.  I think about her because I know it was the first dog's mercy and the hand-me-down wit of the second that saved my life that time they were boiling the soup.
<P>I hear these words--Get under the house, Melvin, fetch that white puppy now.  Bam! My  mama trows me in the farthest house corner and sits down on me.  I cover up with her but once Melvin is in play distance I can't help it.  I've got that curious streak of all the Indian dogs.  I peek right around my mother's tail and whoops, he's got me.  He drags me out and gives me to a grandma, who stuffs me in a gunnysack and slings me down beside the fire.
<P>
I fight the bag there for a while but it's warm and cozy and I go to sleep.  I don't think much of it.  Just another human habit I'll get used to, this stuffing dogs in sacks.  Then I hear them talking.
<P>
Sharpen up the knife.  Grandma's voice.
<P>
That's a nice fat white puppy.  Someone else.
<P>
He'll make a good soup, but do you think enough to go around?  Should we kill another one?
<P>
Then, right above me, they start arguing about whether or not I'll feed twenty.  Me, just a little chunk of a guy, <I>owah!</I> No!  I bark.  No!  No!  I'm not enough for even five of your big strong warrior sons.  Not me.  What am I saying?  I'm not enough for any of you!  Anybody!  No!  I'm sour meat.  I don't want to be eaten!  In response, I get this tap from a grandma shoe, just a tap, but all us dogs know feet language.  Be quiet or you'll get a solid one, it means.  I shut up.  Once I stop barking all I can do is think and I think fast.  I think furious.  I think desperate puppy thoughts until I know what I'll do the moment they let me out.
<P>
A puppy has just one weapon, and there really is no word for it but puppyness.  Stuck in that bag, I muster all my puppyness.  I call my tail wags and love licks up from deep way back, from the dogs going back to dogs unto the beginning of our association with these strange exasperating things called humans.  I hear them stroking the steel on steel.  I hear them tapping the boiling water pot.  I hear them deciding I'll be enough, just barely.  Then daylight.  The bag loosens and a grandma draws me forth and just quick, because I'm smart, desperate, and connected with my ancestors, I look for the nearest girl child in the bunch around me.  I spot her.  I pick her out.
<P>
She's a visitor, sitting right there with a cousin, playing, not noting me at all.  I give a friendly little whine, a yap, and then, as the grandma hauls me toward the table, a sharp loud bark of fear.  That starts out of me.  I can't help it.  But good thing, because the girl hears it and responds.
<P>
"Grandma," she says, "what you going to do with the puppy?"
<P>
"Where'smyogleyzigzichaogleyzigzicha," mumbles Grandma, the way they do when trying to hide their actions.
<P>
"What?"  That gets her little-girl curiosity up, a trait us dogs and children share in equal parts, what makes us love each other so.
<P>
"Don't you know, you dummy," shouts that boy cousin in boy knowledge, "Grandma's going to boil it up, make it into soup!"
<P>
"Aaay," my girl says, shy and laughing. "Grandma wouldn't do that."  And she holds out her hands for me.  Which is when I use my age old Original Dog puppyness.  I throw puppy love right at her in loopy yo-yos, puppy drool, joy, and big-pawed puppy clabber, ear perks, eye contact, most of all the potent weapon of all puppies, the head cock and puppy grin."
<P>
"Gimme him, gimme!"
<P>
"Noooo," says Grandma, holding me tight and pursing her lips in that terrible way of grandmas, when they cannot be swayed.  But she's dealing with her own descendant in its purest form--pure girl.  Puppy-loving girl.
<P>
<I>"Grandmagrandmagrandma!"</I> she shrieks.
<P>
"Eeeeh!"
<P>
"GIMMEDAPUPPY!GIMMEDAPUPPY!"
<P>
Now it's time for me to wiggle, all over, to give the high-quotient adorability wiggle all puppies know.  This is life or death.  I do it double time, triple time, full of puppy determination, desperate to live.
<P>
"Ooooh," says another grandma, sharp-eyed, "quick, trow him in the pot!"
<P>
"Noooh," says yet another, "she wants that puppy bad, her."
<P>
"Give her that little dog," says a grandpa now, his grandpa heart swelling up.  "She wants that dog.  So give her that little dog."
<P>
My girl's doll-playing fingers are brushing my fur.  She's ju7mpting for me.  Spinning like a sweet maple seed.  Straining up toward her grandma, who at this point can't hold on to me without looking almost supernaturally mean.  And so it is, I feel those ancient dog-cooking fingers give me up before her disappointed voice does.
<P>
"Here."
<P>
And just like that I'm in the most heavenly of places.  Soft, strong girl arms.  I'm carried off to be petted and played with, fed scraps, dragged around in a baby carriage made of an old shoe box, dressed in the clothing of tiny brothers and sisters.  Yes.  I'll do anything.  Anything.  This is when my naming happens.  As we go off I hear the grandpa calling from behind us in amusement, asking the name of the puppy.  Me.  And my calls back, without hesitation, the name I will bear from then on into my age, the name that has given so many of our breedless breed hope, the name that will live on in dogness down through the generations.  You've heard it.  You know it.  Almost Soup.
