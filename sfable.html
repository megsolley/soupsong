<h5>
<U>Dr. Seuss' <I>Sleep Book</I></U>:  <BR>
Do you walk in your sleep..?<BR>
I just had a report<BR>
Of some interesting news of this popular sport.<BR>
Near Finnigan Fen, there's a sleepwalking group<BR>
Which not only walks, but it walks a-la-hoop!<BR>
Every night they go miles.  Why, they walk to such length<BR>
They have to keep eating to keep up their strength.<BR>
So, every so often, one puts down his hoop,<BR>
Stops hooping and does some quick snooping for soup.<BR>
That's why they are known as the Hoop-Soup-Snoop Group.<BR>
