<H5>Sweet and buttery, this elegant soup has a pure taste and delicate orange-yellow color, like a summer day.  Lynda Finn, who contributed this recipe, lives in Waitakere, New Zealand, and  is a keen cook, the mother of two boys (who have always appreciated  her culinary skills!) and author of the size-acceptance and self-esteem book <I>Largely Happy</I>.  She makes a strong case for letting the carrots and butter stand on their own merits without the complications of other flavors:  "One Christmas", she says, "when I lived in England, we invited a bunch of U.S. Marines from the local airbase to have dinner with us. Most of them had a 'thing' about carrots, had hated them since childhood, but all were willing to try this soup and not one left any in the bowl, several even asked for the recipe. I think the special difference is butter, accept no substitute, butter--The Magic Ingredient."  I agree.  Serve hot as a first course to 4 people. </H5>

<UL>
<LI>4 Tablespoons <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>
<LI>12 young, sweet <A HREF="fcarrot.html">carrots</A>, scrubbed and chopped
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">milk</A>
<LI>whisps of <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt </A>and very finely ground <A HREF="fpiper.html">white pepper</A>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I> Spatters of <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">heavy cream</A>, topped with grindings of <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A>, <A HREF="bgarnish.html">garlic croutons</A>, and/or <A HREF="bgarnish.html">toasted sesame and pumpkin seeds</A>.


<P>
Melt the butter in a saucpan over medium heat, add the carrots, and cook slowly for 6-10 minutes (the longer you cook, the sweeter and more roasted the taste).  Pour in the stock and milk, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for 8-10 minutes, til the carrots are tender.  Puree, solids first, and don't be quick about pouring all the liquid in at once.  You want a thick and creamy consistency, not a watery soup.  If the consistency is too thick, of course, you can always thin with a little more milk.  Pour back into the pan, season to taste with salt and pepper, and simmer another minute or two.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, spatter with some heavy cream, and top with the pepper, garlic croutons, and/or toasted sesame and pumpkin seeds.  [Or, if you want to be really bad, like me, you can instead just ladle into bowls, dot with a little butter, and spatter with cream.]
