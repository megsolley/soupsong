<P>
Celery root is NOT the root of the <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery</A> we buy in the stores.  Both are members of the same family, but more like first cousins once removed.  Sure, celeriac produces stalks--but they are as tough and strong as their root is sweet and spongy.
<P>
It looks like a big knobby piece of wood in the store--and packs a mere 154 calories <I>per pound!</I> Although it's pretty high in sodium, it's a dieter's dream vegetable--filling, rich, fibrous, massively nutritious, and ostentatiously lacking in calories.  Although it doesn't have the satisfying crunch of celery, it can be substituted for it in any cooked dish.
<P>
Originally cultivated in the Mediterranean and in northern Europe, it was finally introduced into England in the 18th century--and didn't take long to wander over to the New World from there, though it's never really caught on as a main-stream vegetable.  The French adore it and can't get enough of it in a cold julienne as a first course.
