<HR>

<H5>Here luxury's the common lot.  The light<BR>
Lies on the rain-pocked rocks like yellow wool<BR>
And around the rocks the soil is rusty bright<BR>
From too much wealth of water, so that the grass<BR>
Mashes under the foot, and all is full<BR>
Of heat and juice and a heavy jammed excess.
<P>
Whatever moves moves with the slow complete<BR>
Gestures of statuary.  Flower smells<BR>
Are set in the golden day, and shelled in heat,<BR>
Pine and columnar cypress stand.  The palm<BR>
Sinks its combs in the sky.  The whole South swells<BR>
To a soft rigor, a rich and crowded calm.
<P>
Only the olive contradicts.  My eye,<BR>
Traveling slopes of rust and green, arrests<BR>
And rests from plenitude where olives lie<BR>
Like clouds of doubt against the earth's array.<BR>
Their faint disheveled foliage divests<BR>
The sunlight of its color and its sway.
<P>
Not that the olive spurns the sun; its leaves<BR>
Scatter and point to every part of the sky,<BR>
Like famished fingers waving.  Brilliance weaves<BR>
And sombers down among them, and among<BR>
The anxious silver branches, down to the dry<BR>
And tsisted tgrunk, by rooted hunger wrung.
<P>
Even when seen from near, the olive shows<BR>
A hue of far away.  Perhaps for this<BR>
The dove brought olive back, a tree which grows<BR>
Unearthly pale, which ever dims and dries,<BR>
And whose great thirst, exceeding all excess,<BR>
Teaches the South it is not paradise.</H5>
