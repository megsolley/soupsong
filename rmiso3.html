<HR>
<H5>This is a nice Japanese miso soup that is very accessible to "westerners" but drop dead authentic.  It's nice because it observes the custom of one floating and one sinking ingredient.  Serve hot to 4 people as a course.  </H5>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI>1/2 pound <A HREF="fpotato.html">potatoes</A>, peeled, quartered, then sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces and soaked in a bowl of cold water
<LI>3 <A HREF="fleek.html">leeks</A>, cut into 1-inch pieces
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">dashi</A>
<LI>4 Tablespoons <A HREF="fbeans.html">red miso</A> (aka)
</UL>
Bring the dashi to a boil and stir in potatoes, cooking over medium-high heat until half done.  Add leeks and cook until both are tender.  Skim off any foam.
<P>
Pour off 1/2 cup dashi and whisk miso into it.  Slowly stir back into the soup.  Remove from heat just before the soup comes to a boil and ladle immediately into soup bowls, distributing vegetables evenly.  Serve immediately.
