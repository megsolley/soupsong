<HR>
<H5>Ajoblanco, according to recipe contributor Jos&#233; Luis Vivas, is a Weight Watcher's worst nightmare. Thanks to the high energy contents of the almonds and bread, it is a caloric bomb. In fact, he says, these soups were usually consumed by country
laborers in Andalusia during the harvest months as a mid-morning snack. They would have breakfast very early (5:00 AM) and about 11:00 they stopped to prepare the soup (or have someone bring it from the house), take it and brace themselves for temperatures above 95&#176; F from noon onwards. Logically, they stopped about 14:00 and had some light lunch... and a siesta, unless they were picking cotton and a storm was on the way.  
<P>
The soup is wonderful--refreshing and very "drinkable" in texture, with unexpected richness, depth of flavor, and true savoriness.  Hard to believe it's so bad for you.  Serve cold to 6-8 people.</H5>
<HR>

<H5><UL>
<LI>250 grams (it's a lot, about a half a pound) crusty <A HREF="bthicken.html">white bread</A>--<U>with the crusts cut off</U>
<LI>water, to soak the bread thoroughly
<LI> 100 grams raw (not toasted) peeled <A HREF="fnuts.html">almonds</A> (to peel, dip them for a few seconds in openly boiling water then pop them off with a squeeze)
<LI>2 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>
<LI>1.5 litres (7 cups) cold water
<LI>200 cc (1 large cup) <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI><A HREF="bflavor.html">Vinegar</A> (red wine or sherry vinegar preferred)
</UL>

<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  In Málaga it is customary to serve it with peeled and seeded <A HREF="fgrape.html">grapes</A>, or <A HREF="fapple.html">apple slices</A>. <A HREF="fcantalo.html">Melon</A>, small <A HREF="fshrimp.html">shrimps</A> or sliced, roasted <A HREF="fnuts.html">almonds</A> also go very well with this soup.
<P>
Soak the bread in water.  With a powerful blender, grind the almonds, together with the garlic and a little salt, as fine as you can (the finer they are ground, the creamier the
result will be). Then add the soaked bread and blend until you get a white homogeneous paste. Still blending, add the oil in a thread, as you would in a mayonnaise, and then the vinegar (for the quantity, follow your taste, but just a spritz is sufficient--otherwise you will mask the taste) and the water. Adding the oil and water must be done slowly: you
want a smooth emulsion, not curd!
<P>
That's it. Serve it very cold--and with the garnish of your choice:  sliced and seeded grapes, or apple slices, or melon, or small shrimps or even sliced, roasted almonds.</H5>
