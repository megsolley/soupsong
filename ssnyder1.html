<BR>
"A.J. Bayless market bent wire roller basket buy up parsnips,<BR>
onion, carrot, rutabaga and potato, bell green pepper,<BR>
& nine cuts of dark beef shank.<BR>
They run there on their legs, that makes meat tasty.
<P>
   "Seven at night in Tucson, get some bisquick for the dumplings.<BR>
Have some bacon.  Go to Hadley's in the kitchen right beside the <BR>
frying steak--Diana on the phone--get a little plastic bag from<BR>
Drum--<BR>
fill it up with tarragon and chili; four bay leaves; black pepper<BR>
corns and basil; powdered oregano, something free, maybe about<BR>
two teaspoon worth of salt.
<P>
   "Now down in Sonora, Pinacate country, build a fire of Ocotillo,<BR>
broken twigs and bits of ironweed, in an open ring of lava:  rake <BR>
some coals aside (and if you're smart) to windward,<BR>
keep the other half ablaze for heat and light.<BR>
Set Drum's fourteen-inch dutch oven with three legs across the<BR>
embers.
<P>
   "Now put in the strips of bacon.<BR>
In another pan have all the vegetables cleaned up and peeled and<BR> 
sliced.<BR>
Cut the beef shank meat up small and set the bone aside.<BR>
Throw in the beef shank meat,<BR>
And stir it while it fries hot,<BR>
lots of ash and sizzle--singe your brow--
<P>
   "Like Locke says almost burn it--then add water from the jeep<BR>
can--<BR>
add the little bag of herbs--cook it all five minutes more--and<BR>
then throw in the pan of all the rest.<BR>
Cover it up with big hot lid all heavy, sit and wait, or drink bud-<BR>
weiser beer.
<P>
   "And also mix the dumpling mix aside, some water in some bisquick,<BR>
finally drop that off the spoon into the stew.<BR>
And let it cook ten minutes more <BR>
and lift the black pot off the fire<BR>
to set aside another good ten minutes,<BR>
Dish it up and eat it with a spoon, sitting on a poncho in the dark."
