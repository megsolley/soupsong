<HR>
<H5>A rich yet delicate beginning to an elegant meal, this creamy American classic should be served in small bowls with a special garnish.  I recommend a tiny dribbling of cream topped with finely minced celery leaves and finely crushed peanuts.  Serve hot as a first course to 6.</H5>

<P>
Saute onion and celery in the butter until soft, but not brown.  Stir in the flour and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds or so.  Stir in the stock a little at a time, whisking, then bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Puree, solids first, then whisk in peanut butter and cream until the soup is smooth.
<P>
When ready to serve, reheat (don't let boil), then ladle into small bowls.  Dribble a half-teaspoonful of cream in a pretty pattern, then sprinkle with minced celery leaves and finely crushed peanuts.  Serve immediately.
