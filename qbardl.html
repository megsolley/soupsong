<U>Henry VI, part 2, III, 1</U>:<BR>
SUFFOLK:  The fox barks not when he would steal the <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A>.
        No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
        Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
<P>
KING HENRY:   but, shall I speak my conscience,
        Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
        From meaning treason to our royal person
        As is the sucking <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A> or harmless dove:
        The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
        To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
<P>
QUEEN MARGARET:  Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
        Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,
        For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
        Is he a <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A>? his skin is surely lent him,
        For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
<P>
<U>Cymbeline, I, 6</U>:<BR>
IACHIMO:   The cloyed will,
        That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
        Both fill'd and running, ravening first the <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A>
        Longs after for the garbage.
<P>
IMOGEN:   Prithee, dispatch:
        The <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A> entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
        Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
        When I desire it too. (III, 4)
<P>
<U>Titus Andronicus, II, 3</U>:<BR>
MARTIUS:   Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
        All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A>,
        In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
PERDITA:   I'll not put
        The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
        No more than were I painted I would wish
        This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
        Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
        Hot <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">lavender</A>, <A HREF="fmint.html">mints</A>, <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">savoury</A>, <A HREF="fmarjora.html">marjoram</A>;
        The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
        And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
        Of middle summer, and I think they are given
        To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

<U>King Henry V, IV, 7</U>:<BR>
FLUELLEN:        Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is
        remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
        garden where leeks did grow, wearing <A HREF="fleek.html">leeks</A> in their
        Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this
        hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do
        believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the <A HREF="fleek.html">leek</A>
        upon Saint Tavy's day.
<P>
FLUELLEN:       Much good do you, scauld knave, heartily. Nay, pray
        you, throw none away; the skin is good for your
        broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see <A HREF="fleek.html">leeks</A>
        hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em; that is all. (V, 1)
<P>
FLUELLEN:        Ay, <A HREF="fleek.html">leeks</A> is good: hold you, there is a groat to
        heal your pate. (V, 1)
<P>
<U>A Midsummer's Night Dream, V, 1</U>:<BR>
THISBE:            Asleep, my love?
        What, dead, my dove?
        O Pyramus, arise!
        Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
        Dead, dead? A tomb
        Must cover thy sweet eyes.
        These My lips,
        This <A HREF="fcherry.html">cherry </A>nose,
        These yellow cowslip cheeks,
        Are gone, are gone:
        Lovers, make moan:
        His eyes were green as <A HREF="fleek.html">leeks</A>.

<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 2</U>:<BR>
ARMADO (for Hector):  "The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty, Gave Hector a gift------"<BR>
DUMAIN:  A gilt <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmeg</A>.<BR>
BEROWNE:  A <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lemon</A>.<BR>
LONGAVILLE:  Stuck with <A HREF="fclove.html">cloves</A>.<BR>
DUMAIN:  No cloven.

<U>Othello, The Moor of Venice, I, 3</U>:<BR>
IAGO:    Virtue! <A HREF="ffig.html">a fig</A>! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
        or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
        our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
        nettles, or sow <A HREF="fgreens.html">lettuce</A>, set <A HREF="fhyssop.html">hyssop</A> and weed up
        <A HREF="fthyme.html">thyme</A>, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
        distract it with many, either to have it sterile
        with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
        power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
        wills.
