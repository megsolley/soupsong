Talk about an appetite stimulator!  This light, creamy soup is layered with flavors, is a lovely shade of green, and boy does it pack a punch, leaving your lips tingling in the most pleasant way.  Many thanks to David Janssen of Blaine, Minnesota, for the recipe.  David has gathered recipes and food ideas from his business travels throughout Europe and North America and recreated them in his kitchen--like this one.  Soups and stews are his particular favorites "because of the flavors that can be achieved in one pot...it's good eats on a cold winter day or night."  Serve hot to 4-6 people as a first course for dinner or with a sandwich or salad for lunch.
