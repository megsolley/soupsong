<A HREF="zmay04.html">Read a shocking amount of information on Aristophanes and soup, the examples below just to whet your appetite:</A><P>
<U>Aristophanes, 4th century BCE Athenian comic poet, in <I>Lysistrata:</I></U><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I saw a cavalry captain buy vegetable soup on horseback.  He carried the whole mess home in his helmet"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<U>Aristophanes, in <I>Plutus</I> (388 BC)</U>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>CHREMYLUS ...In short, 
Plutus, it is through you that everything is done; you must realize 
that you are the sole cause both of good and evil. 
<BR>  CARIO In war, it's the flag under which you serve that victory favours. 
<BR> PLUTUS   What! I can do so many things by myself and unaided? 
<BR>  CHREMYLUS    And many others besides; wherefore men are never tired of your 
 gifts. They get weary of all else,-of love... 
<BR>  CARIO     Bread. 
<BR> CHREMYLUS     Music.  
<BR>CARIO      Sweetmeats. 
<BR>   CHREMYLUS   Honours. 
<BR>  CARIO     Cakes. 
<BR>   CHREMYLUS   Battles. 
<BR> CARIO     Figs. 
<BR>CHREMYLUS   Ambition. 
<BR>  CARIO    Gruel. 
<BR>CHREMYLUS  Military advancement. 
<BR> CARIO    Lentil soup. 
<BR> CHREMYLUS   But of you they never tire. If a man has thirteen talents, he 
has all the greater ardour to possess sixteen; if that wish is achieved, he will want forty or will complain that he knows not how to make both ends meet.

<U>Moli&#232;re's  <I>L'&#201;cole des femmes</I> (1662) or, <I>The School for Wives</I>:</U>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Alain remarks, "La femme est en effet le potage de l'homme : et quand un homme voit d'autres hommes parfois qui veulent dans sa soupe aller tremper leurs doigts, il en montre aussit&#244;t une col&#232;re extr&#234;me."</BLOCKQUOTE>
Many thanks to Sarah Thomas, Bloomington, Indiana, for the contribution.  Her translation: "Woman is truly the soup of man : and when a man sees other men who want to dip their fingers in his soup, he quickly shows an extreme anger of it."

<U>Aristophanes, The Frogs (405 BC)</U>:
<BLOCKQUOTE> DIONYSUS   I can't describe it. 
     But yet I'll tell you in a riddling way. 
    Have you e'er felt a sudden lust for soup? 
<BR>   HERACLES  Soup! Zeus-a-mercy, yes, ten thousand times. 
<BR>   DIONYSUS  Is the thing clear, or must I speak again? 
<BR>  HERACLES      Not of the soup: I'm clear about the soup. 
<BR> DIONYSUS   Well, just that sort of pang devours my heart   For lost Euripides. </BLOCKQUOTE>
Miriam Weiss offers this even more appealing translation by Dudley Fitts:
<BLOCKQUOTE>DIONYSOS: Tell me, O Herakles, hast ever been seized by a craving for pea soup?<BR>
HERAKLES: Over and over again.<BR>
DIONYSOS: "Spake not my tongue plainly," or must I elaborate?<BR>
HERAKLES: I see pea soup in my mind's eye.<BR>
DIONYSOS: Just such a longing consumeth me now for Euripides.</BLOCKQUOTE>
