<P>
     Amazing soup! (how sweet the taste!) <BR>
         That fill'd a wretch like me!<BR>
     I once did hunger, now am sate;<BR>
         Did thirst, am now replete.
<P>
     'Twas soup that filled my heart with pain<BR>
         And soup that pain reliev'd;<BR>
     How precious did that soup appear,<BR>
         The hour I first dipped in't.
<P>
     Thro' many appetizers, salads and sweets,<BR>
       I have already ate;<BR>
   'Tis soup that gratified my need,<BR>
       And soup will content me. <P>

   The Lord has promis'd broth to me,<BR>
       His word my hope secures;<BR>
   He will my consomme provide,<BR>
       As long as life endures.<P>

   Yes, when this meat and veg shall fail, <BR>
       And mortal life shall cease;<BR>
   I shall possess, within the veil,<BR>
       Some vichysoisse and peace.<P>

   This earth shall soon dissolve like snow,<BR>
       The sun forbear to shine;<BR>
   But borscht, which call'd me here below,<BR>
       Will be for ever mine.<P>
