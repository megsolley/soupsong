<H5>Immortalized by Pablo Neruda in his <I>
Elementos Odas'</I>"Oda al Caldillo de Congrio," this classic fish soup of the Chilean coast is simple, tasty, and filling.  If you first read <A HREF="sconger.html">Neruda's poem</A>, though, you will cook it up in a haze of pleasure and dine on it in heaven.  If you want to add potatoes for heartiness, cook them, diced, in a little fish stock until tender and add with the fish.  Serve hot to 4 as a meal, ideally with lots of crusty bread and good Chilean wine.   </H5>

Heat the oil in a large pot and stir in garlic, onions, and jalapeno pepper and saut&#233; until soft.  Add the tomato pieces and cook down over medium heat, about 8 minutes.  Toss in the eel and the shrimp, covering and steaming for  about 2 minutes.  Remove cover and let stew gently for 5 more minutes, until the eel is just done and a little shrunk.  Pour in the reserved tomato juice and stock and bring to a boil.  Stir in the cooked potatoes, if you decide to use them, and return to a simmer. Stir in cream.  When the chowder is simmering, it is ready to serve.  Fork the eel off the bone into the soup, discarding the bone.  Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with minced parsley or scallion.</H5>
