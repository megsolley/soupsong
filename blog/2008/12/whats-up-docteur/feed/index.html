		<description><![CDATA[On sweetness and carrots... I remember sitting on a wooden platform floating on water in the café of the National Muséum in Canberra (Australia), I tried a carrot and coconut milk broth with grilled scallops while watching an installation.  In a forest of reeds, pipes were blowing some sort of fogs in periods... I thought that anytime, I would see the reeds open up and Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, with his usual stunned and bewildered look, on a spirited horse, appear to then disappear again in a splash!!!  Well my imagination having no limits at what it can come up with, I have concocted from this original dish, a carrot, coconut milk, boiled orange and cardamom soup which I have served in my restaurant... My laboratory rats (live guinea pigs or customers) have declared it a success so I will have to keep it going now for the winter menu!  And of course, I keep having those wonderful tasty organic carrots from the local supplier as a base!  Yummy!]]></description>
