		<description>Hi Pat

I enjoy your stories of your adventures, reading the recipes and, cooking them.  The recipe for Chicken Waterzooie has us add leeks, celery, carrots and onions to the mix, however, once we remove the chicken and strain the broth, it doesn't mention whether we add the cooked vegetables back to the finished soup.  The photo of the soup from La Belle Epoch looks like vegetables are included.  If you have a few minutes, please let me know whether Chicken Waterzooie is served with vegetables.  

Sincerely
Shirley</description>
