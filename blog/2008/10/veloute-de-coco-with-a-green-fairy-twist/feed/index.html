		<description>Chicken noodle soup is yummy but chicken noodle soup is hot so if you come home from a winter day where it's cold and windy you could just make some chicken noodle soup.  "It's a song of soup- by Billie." she says.  And it's true, right Mom?  That songs true.
Jackson has no comment.
Sloane- I wanna say I love sausage.  Nanna Pat loves sausage.  (I have NO idea why she just said that?!)
Cort- bladebladdd dada.</description>

		<description>Oh..goodie goodie goodie!!! I'm the first to blog! (You've created a blogging monster Pat.) LOVED reading abut your adventures with soup in Paris. Reminded me of when I ordered steak tartare and the resto served it to me well done - as they, like many French, decide what they think is good for you! Also, loved seeing Ana's pic.</description>
