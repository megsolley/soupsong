		<description><![CDATA[I remember a wonderful time in Tasmania ( for those geographically handicaped, it is one of the states of Australia)when we had mud oysters.  They were farmed for the Japenese for their famous oyster sauce.  They are the New york cut steak of the oyster world... Huge and so rich!!!! You only needed 4 to make a soup as they were so huge and you definetely do not slip these delicately down your throat, you need fork and knife!!!  Wonderful to read your comments, Pat, as always!]]></description>
