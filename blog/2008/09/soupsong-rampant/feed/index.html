		<description>Glad to see you back.  Looking forward to more recipes &#38; observations.

Udon--yum, yum, yum.  Ramen always seems to be the crowd favorite, but give me udon any day.

		<description>Patti,
  What fun to read about your life, travels, and of course, your experiences with soup! We'll always remember our soup-filled winters in Manassas- it was great being your recipe guinea pigs. It just seems natural to have Meg involved now. Love to you both. Betsy</description>

		<description>Hi Pat

I was making your Baked Potato Soup, and came onto Soupsong to verify the recipe and discovered you are adding more recipes.  How wonderful!!!!  I am so glad you are back and still loving soup.  I'll stay in touch.

		<description>On noodles, please read the book by Australian author Terry Durack (ISBN 1-86448-347-4) if it is still in print!  It is thorough in its presentation of noodles, and love the recipes described as "slurpy".  Owning a hotel-restaurant and living in the "france profonde", I do miss the noodle bars of big cities such as Sydney and London... The excellent Yum cha in London in China Town, the "lazy Suzan" full of steaming noodle bowls in Toronto and the most heart warming "Pho" in the streets of Saigon! Long live the noodles!!!!
And yes if you are wondering, I am the sister of the "belle Christine"... A family of foodies!  I love soups and my master in soup-making was a drunden Moori Chef from New Zealand!  I only work with him for 6 months but oh boy!  did I learn a lot... Love the blog, you are such a fantastic researcher, keep it going please!</description>

		<description>Can't tell you how happy I am to hear sweet "soupsong" again.
As for udon - anyone who has lived in Japan certainly must have udon on a regular basis - Paris sounds like as good a place as any to enjoy those yummy noodles.
Love ya!</description>
