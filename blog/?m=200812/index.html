<p>Back in September, when I was hyperventilating over the beauty of my just one-year-old granddaughter Rosalind in Seattle, I got taken out to lunch by the urbanspoon.com guys, where daughter Meg had been working part time. Don&#8217;t know about <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com">urbanspoon.com</a>? You should. Among other amazing things that it does, it lets you use the GPS on your ipod to locate the closest, say, SOUP restaurant to your own two feet at that moment, then draws you a map to get there and lets you read reviews about it before you walk through the door. I tried it out on Patrick&#8217;s ipod&#8211;incredible and incredibly easy. Plus I got the t-shirt. &#8220;Take it to Paris,&#8221; Adam said, &#8220;we&#8217;d love to urbanspoon that city too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when Ana suggested we Pudlo on Friday night, I finally remembered to pop the t-shirt in my bag for a trial spin.</p>
<p>Pudlo?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the brilliant Gilles Pudlowski&#8217;s restaurant guide of Paris. Ana and I go Pudloing the way Oscar Wilde&#8217;s Algy Moncrieff goes Bunburying.</p>
<p>La Gorille Blanc is a Pudlo &#8220;Special Favorite.&#8221; It&#8217;s in the 7th Arrondissement on the Left Bank, within spitting distance of the great Bon Marche department store and food emporium. Bernard Arény has made a truly sweet spot of it, bringing in a great chef with a fabulous menu, and consecrating the place to <em>Flocon de neige</em> (Snowflake), the astonishing albino gorilla who was captured in equitorial Guinea by the Fang tribe in 1966 and thence transported to the Barcelona zoo. Snowflake lived to the great age of 40 and fathered some 21 babies, none of them albinos. When Arény visited him in Barcelona, it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>The restaurant is tiny, charged with a warm, rich, and silvergleaming atmosphere, and hung with portraits of Snowflake. Ana and I are the first people in the place (typical Americans&#8211;&#8221;only&#8221; 7:30 pm) and it&#8217;s a good thing, cause we cheerfully go about making asses out of ourselves. &#8220;Ha ha ha,&#8221; says Ana, &#8220;My friend is going to write up this evening&#8217;s meal on the Internet, is it okay to use the camera?&#8221; &#8220;Ha ha ha, oh yes, that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; says the darling waitress. M. Arény is in the background, very chic in his brick red shirt and black trousers. Ana takes a picture of me tucking the Urbanspoon t-shirt under my jacket and posing next to a picture of Snowflake climbing a ladder. Nope, can&#8217;t see the logo. How about putting the t-shirt logo on top of the photo? <em>Non, non, non!</em> M. Areny rushes up with a different and great photo of Snowflake&#8217;s head and takes over the stage managing of the whole shot, pictured. We love it and hope you do too. And we&#8217;re all relieved that we got THAT out of the way.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve ordered. We&#8217;re embarked on a lovely pichet of St. Emilion Bordeaux. And oh la la, the soup arrives and it&#8217;s gorgeous! <em>Un velouté de chataignes en cappuccino aux cèpes séchés</em>, or creamy chestnut soup with a porcini mushroom emulsion, splashed with paprika and topped with chervil. Oh my. Ana and I both want to dive in head first, but the staff springs into photography support. I take a picture with the flash and it doesn&#8217;t do the dish justice. Candlesticks appear from all directions and we end up with the photo you see. It DOES do the <em>look</em> of the soup justice, but not the taste and feel. The soup is light, rich, and sweet but goes into palate overdrive when paired with the musky froth of deeply flavored mushrooms.  Something to suck through your teeth and savor in small swallows, if only you had that kind of self control.</p>
<p>And the rest of the dinner follows suit, Ana so happy with <em>la terrine de champignon à la crème d&#8217;ail</em> (mushroom terrine) and both of us with <em>le fricassé de lapin et oignons aux raisins secs </em>(stewed rabbit), not to mention the superb desserts&#8211;price for each of us, including wine and tip, 45 euros.  Not bad!</p>
<p>We highly recommend it: LA GORILLE BLANC<br />
11 bis, rue Chomel<br />
75007 Paris<br />
01.45.49.04.54</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll work on developing a recipe for this marvelous chestnut soup, but in the meantime, if you simply must have chestnut soup today, try the much heartier <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/rchestnu.html">Hungarian recipe for Creamy Chestnut and Smoked Ham Soup</a> on my website.</p>

<p>My Dad took an awful fall this past Friday night and split his hip bone in half.  Not something a former B-29 pilot likes to admit, even if he is an octogenarian+ with the weakest pins a man could ever be cursed with.  The good news is that it happened in Durham, NC, and he&#8217;s in the great Duke hospital for care&#8211;now titanium/ceramic man, convalescing with a hip replacement.  The bad news is that it happened in Durham, NC, and I&#8217;m here in Paris, France, feeling like a complete dumbbell of a daughter.</p>
<p>When in doubt, make soup.  In this case, I made a completely magnificent chicken stock last night and got in tonight from work to skim off the congealed fat and find it pure, strong, and heady.  Add pressed garlic, soup noodles, salt, and white pepper.  Toss in chopped greens at the end and top with parsley.  It&#8217;s called <em>Savoyarde soupe de fides </em>and is a soup famous for curing farmers in the snowy French Alps of what ails them.  You DO know about <a href="http://soupsong.com/zjan03.html">chicken soup curing what ails you</a>, right? So why not use it to hasten the cure of a hip replacement?  That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking.</p>
<p>There it is pictured, can&#8217;t you just smell the fragrance and imagine biting into those slices of <em>pavé châtaigne pain</em> (chestnut bread) slathered in AOC butter&#8230;sipping that glass of flinty Sancerre?</p>
<p>Open your mouth wide, Dad.  I&#8217;m about to email you some big spoonsful of <em>Soupe de Fides. </em>I think I can already hear the sweet sounds of it knitting your bones back together.</p>
<p><em>Soupe de Fides</em> (for 2)</p>
<p>3 cups rich chicken stock<br />
1 garlic clove, pressed<br />
1/2 cup broken-up fine soup noodles<br />
1/4 cup chopped fresh greens and herbs<br />
salt and white pepper to taste<br />
sprigs of parsley to garnish</p>
<p>Bring the stock to a boil over medium-high heat with the garlic and cook for a minute.  Add noodles and cook, uncovered, until they&#8217;re just done, from 3-5 minutes.  Add the greens/herbs just as you take the pan off the fire.  Stir, season with salt and pepper, ladle into two bowls, and top with sprigs of parsley.</p>
<p>Bon appetit&#8230;and get better, Dad.</p>

<p>
Such a miserable day. Cold rain coming down in buckets. Clearly time to execute my fave rainy lunchtime activity: Dash to the metro at <em>Place Concorde</em>, jump up two stops on Line 1, and worm my way underground to the Carrousel entrance of the Louvre. I&#8217;ve got the Bronzes Français exhibit on my mind. But as I start up the escalator to the Richelieu wing, I&#8217;m assailed by a tantalyzing aroma &#8230;and spot a café just right there on the balcony. No harm in seeing what&#8217;s on the menu.</p>
<p>
Oh my, Bugs Bunny would be excited:  a steaming cauldron of <em>Crème Crécy</em> for 4,20 euro a shot. I can&#8217;t resist. There you see it&#8211;carrots times a thousand; piping hot; the first sip so sweet that you think the Louvre must surely be shopping at the local bio farm; a dash of white pepper, undersalted, tiny little sprigs of curly parsley. It&#8217;s exactly like so many French household soups: plain, pure, light, yet filling your belly and warming you up.</p>
<p>
Carrots in France.  Totally interesting.  The French didn&#8217;t love them until well into the Middle Ages (originally from Afghanistan, they came in red, purple, black, yellow, and white varietals and weren&#8217;t hybridized to beta-carotene orange til the Dutch got their hands on them).  Then docs prescribed them for everything from sexual maladies to snakebite.  For good eyesight too, of course.  And the best ones were grown in Crécy, which famously gave the name to the classic carrot soup of France.  But Crécy-en-Ponthieu, the site of the English victory in 1346, up near Abbeville&#8230;or Crécy-en-Brie, to the east of Paris, in the cheese and sugar-beet district of the Marne?  I wouldn&#8217;t dream of chiming in on this enduring controversy.</p>
<p>
But the fact is, this soup&#8211;evolving from purée to potage to crème&#8211;is eloquent, in its own way, and will definitely (according to my English grandmother) improve your eyesight. Why don&#8217;t you just drop everything and fly to Paris to take in both this humble purée AND the Louvre?</p>
<p>
No? Well, it&#8217;s easy enough to put this soup on your table, wherever you are, and quickly, AND in a pumped up Escoffier version that is fabulous:</p>
<p>
<em>Crème Crécy</em> for 4 people</p>
<p>
2 Tablespoons butter<br />
4 medium carrots, peeled and thinly sliced<br />
1 onion, diced<br />
4 cups chicken stock<br />
1/2 cup rice<br />
1 Tablespoon sugar (the sweetness!)<br />
1 teaspoon salt<br />
1 cup cream<br />
salt and white pepper to taste<br />
2 Tablespoons finely minced parsley<br />
1 Tablespoon butter</p>
<p>
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium low heat and toss in the carrots and onion.  Cover and cook slowly for 15 minutes.  Add the stock, rice, sugar, salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.  Purée in a blender, add the cream and parsley, and return to a simmer.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.  If you want a thinner soup, add hot water to taste.  Simmer for 5 minutes then swirl in the butter. Ladle into bowls and top with a parsley leaf.</p>
<p>Bon appetit!  And yes, despite what you read in the American press, the French ALWAYS say Bon Appetit before tucking in, and with a great twinkle in their eye, so happy to be eating a fine meal.</p>
