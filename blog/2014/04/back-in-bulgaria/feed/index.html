I&#039;ve been trying to find you for ages. I inadvertently deleted your email address and have been searching the net to find you. 
You&#039;re still in Paris. We were  there this past wet spring. So happy to have found you again. Hope you are well and your eye is better. Please contact me via email and I will fill you in on what has been happening.
