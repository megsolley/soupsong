		<description><![CDATA[Hello! How remarkable that I had justthought to look at soupsong after so many years - only to find you back in blogging action. I love that website and it has given me some nice ideas for cabbage soup for dinner. Thank you for all your hard work on it over the years - look forward to the new soupedia!

Kind regards
