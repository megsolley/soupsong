		<description>Pat! It's so good to see you blogging again! I have a blog now too, though I don't remember if I've ever told you about it. We're back on the West Coast now, in San Diego again, and it's so nice to be in a familiar place. Glad to see you're enjoying Paris! I hope your dad heals quickly. :-) I will subscribe to the feed of your blog immediately so I don't miss out on anything!</description>

		<description>Cape Town ,South Africa 21 December, 2008
Response about Restaurant Bouillon-Chartier,Paris! 

Marc and I ate there 3 times on a short stay in Paris 3 years ago...this amazingly characterful retaurant was recommended to us by the Concierge at our little hotel nearby...(no!, I wont give you the name- it's a well-kept secret!)
Our intention was to try a different venue each evening, but somehow, the atmosphere of this restaurant drew us back again and again!
We had a similar experience, in that we too, were shown to an occupied table the 1st time, and being South Africans, very aware of 'owning' our "personal space", I was horrified, having to sit with STRANGERS!...well, that's how it's done - even shared the basket of bread, also the caraf of water,too!
The vast menu comprised basic 'good food' -this coming from a discerning cook of many different quisines. 
The highlight for us, was watching the young Chinese waiter, swishing out of the kitchen swing doors, balancing no less than 10 plates of main course meals - 5 plates on each arm! A true master of his trade!
What a super experience this restaurant is!
...to us this is Paris...OUR Paris!
MMMMmmmmmm.....Dont tell anyone tho'!

		<description>ALOHA!  I missed you so much, Pat!  So glad to see you back out here!  I finally bought your book, but because you weren't on the soupsong site I was too sad to read it.  Now I know you are back where you belong, in that giant virtual kitchen of yours, I'll pull it out again.  Have a wonderful Christmas!</description>

		<description>So happy to have you back writing about soup--and to follow your adventures in Paris.  I am in Seattle now where soup seems to suit the climate perfectly.  I wonder, do you still have the ceramic veggies in your coat pocket?</description>

		<description>Glad to see you back.  Looking forward to more recipes &#38; observations.

Udon--yum, yum, yum.  Ramen always seems to be the crowd favorite, but give me udon any day.

		<description>Pat... that's a great picture of your Dad!  I'll say some prayers for him for a quick recovery.  I definitely will try this recipe... it's so simple to make.  I've always believed that chicken soup is a cure all.  Cassie</description>

		<description>On sweetness and carrots... I remember sitting on a wooden platform floating on water in the café of the National Muséum in Canberra (Australia), I tried a carrot and coconut milk broth with grilled scallops while watching an installation.  In a forest of reeds, pipes were blowing some sort of fogs in periods... I thought that anytime, I would see the reeds open up and Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, with his usual stunned and bewildered look, on a spirited horse, appear to then disappear again in a splash!!!  Well my imagination having no limits at what it can come up with, I have concocted from this original dish, a carrot, coconut milk, boiled orange and cardamom soup which I have served in my restaurant... My laboratory rats (live guinea pigs or customers) have declared it a success so I will have to keep it going now for the winter menu!  And of course, I keep having those wonderful tasty organic carrots from the local supplier as a base!  Yummy!</description>

		<description>Hi Pat

I enjoy your stories of your adventures, reading the recipes and, cooking them.  The recipe for Chicken Waterzooie has us add leeks, celery, carrots and onions to the mix, however, once we remove the chicken and strain the broth, it doesn't mention whether we add the cooked vegetables back to the finished soup.  The photo of the soup from La Belle Epoch looks like vegetables are included.  If you have a few minutes, please let me know whether Chicken Waterzooie is served with vegetables.  

Sincerely
Shirley</description>
