		<description><![CDATA[Welcome back Pat
I have made that soup many times, it is so delicious! Fresh, I would say...  I often use &quot;fromage blanc&quot; as I like stronger fuller flavours but good yogurt is nice too.. Yum!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely article on what I consider to be one of the yummiest French soups around. Indeed, it is a Lyon specialty--thanks for setting the story straight for all you readers who think French onion soup, is well, just plain old French. I&#039;m lucky enough to live not too far from Lyon and will certainly put Les Fine Gueules on my list of places to eat on my next trip to France&#039;s other city of lights.]]></description>
