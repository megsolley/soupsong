				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Nitsa-souvla.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-734" src="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Nitsa-souvla-300x225.jpg" alt="Nitsa souvla" width="300" height="225" /></a><a href="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Cypriot-chicken-soup.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-735" src="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Cypriot-chicken-soup-300x225.jpg" alt="Cypriot chicken soup" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>No!  Here you see Nitsa, in the village of Choulou in South Cyprus, tending meat (mostly pork) for a souvla she is cooking up for me, my old school chum Anne, and a table full of delightful expats.  &#8220;Nitsa,&#8221; I said, &#8220;tell me about Cypriot soup.&#8221;  &#8220;I don&#8217;t make soup,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Nobody wants it&#8211;it&#8217;s too hot.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was certainly right about that.  With no air conditioning, no screens on the windows, and a relentlessly blazing sun in a clear blue sky,  it was witheringly hot.  We would get up at 6 am, hike in the hills and dales of  Ezousa valley, below Mt. Olympus and the Troodos mountains, then either siesta through the day or climb into the blessedly air conditioned car to go adventuring.  Yes to see the ruins of ancient Paphos, including the pillar where St. Paul was reputedly chained and whipped.  Yes to see the spot where Aphrodite was born of sea foam&#8211;and explore Sanctuaries to both Apollo and Aphrodite.  Yes to monasteries and churches and abandoned mosques and wineries and Mediterranean beaches and ruins from the 4000 BC Chalcolithic era.  Yes to medieval castles and the remains of Kourion.  Yes to late-night performances of Media, Philoctetes, and Lysistrata in Greek and Roman theaters.</p>
<p>But no soup, despite my best efforts.  Finally in Pissouri we found a restaurant that had chicken and tomato soups on the menu.  And I got what I deserved:  canned chicken broth thickened with flour, absolutely awful.  Let me repeat it:  NO SUMMER SOUP IN THE LAND OF APHRODITE.</p>
<p>But!  Southern Cyprus has a wealth of soups in more temperate seasons.  Nitsa told me about Avgolemeno (egg and lemon) and Trahana (wheat and sour milk). And Amaranth Sitas, in her cookbook <em>Kopiaste </em>describes meatball and fish Avgolemono, a traditional sour lentil soup for Good Friday, and <em>Patcha, </em>a soup made from lamb brain and tongue or lamb head.</p>
<p>Once home in my deliciously air conditioned house, I tried out Sitas&#8217; <em>Yavarlakia avgolemono, </em>the meatball soup.  Delicious.</p>
<p><a href="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yavarlakia-avgolemono.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-736" src="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Yavarlakia-avgolemono-225x300.jpg" alt="Yavarlakia avgolemono" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>YAVARLAKIA AVGOLEMENO (for 8)</p>
<ul>
<li>2/3 pound ground pork</li>
<li>1 cup raw rice</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>finely chopped mint or parsley</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>plate with some flour to roll the meatballs</li>
<li>10 cups chicken stock</li>
<li>For the Avgolemono:  2 eggs and the juice of 1 big lemon</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix the meat, rice, beaten egg, mint/parsley, and salt, then form into very small balls (because the rice expands the size).  Roll lightly in flour.</p>
<p>Bring the stock to a boil in a large pot, then carefully add the meatballs.  Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, partially covered, for 30 minutes, until the rice is tender.  When ready to serve, take the soup off the heat and put to the side.  Beat the eggs and lemon juice for the avgolemono, then beat a cup or so of  hot soup into it, a little at a time.  Add this back into the soup, stirring so that the egg does not curdle.  Taste for seasoning&#8211;both salt and lemon&#8211;then ladle into bowls.  Garnish with a sprig of mint/parsley and serve extra lemon slices on the side.</p>
<p>A last word:  Nitsa told me she would teach me a soup when I came back in cooler weather.  Stay tuned!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheJaguarSmile.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-691" src="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheJaguarSmile-193x300.jpg" alt="TheJaguarSmile" width="193" height="300" /></a> <a href="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nicaragua.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-692" src="http://soupsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nicaragua-225x300.jpg" alt="nicaragua bean soup" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Who knew that Salman Rushie took a break from writing <em>The Satanic Verses</em> and traveled to Nicaragua in the summer of 1986 for three weeks?  He&#8217;d been invited by the <i>Sandinista Association of Cultural Workers, </i>which called itself &#8220;the umbrella organisation that brought writers, artists, musicians, craftspeople, dancers and so on, together under the same roof,&#8221; on the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the Sandinista rise to power.</p>
<p>His account of his travels is, of course, extremely interesting&#8211;and particularly so to me when in July, he visited the Enrique Acuña co-operative and lunched with five resettled <em>campesinos.  </em>&#8220;With the generosity of the poor,&#8221; he says, &#8220;they treated me to a delicacy at lunch.  I was given an egg and bean soup, the point being that these eggs were the best-tasting because they had been fertilized.  Such eggs were known as &#8216;the eggs of love.&#8217;  When people had so little, a fertilized hen&#8217;s egg became a treat.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not wait to discover this recipe.</p>
<p>I looked through my Latin American cookbooks.  I scanned the library catalogs of DC&#8217;s Martin Luther King library and my local Falls Church library.  Almost as an afterthought I googled key words.  And there it was, on my very own website:</p>
<p><strong>SOPA DE FRIJOLES</strong> (serve hot as a meal to 4 people)</p>
<p>This traditional soup of Nicaraguans&#8211;who generally prefer red beans to black&#8211;is both unusual and delicious.  The red bean puree is light and smooth, contrasting with the crisp onion, chunky red pepper, and bursts of intense pork from the <em>chicharrones </em>(pork rinds).  The poached egg on top enriches the soup&#8211;especially if it&#8217;s fertilized!&#8211;a yellow sun on a clay earth terrain.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups dried red beans, soaked overnight in water to cover</li>
<li>8 cups water</li>
<li>10 garlic cloves, sliced</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons corn oil</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 cup onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 cup <i>chicarrones</i> (pork rinds)</li>
<li>1 cup sweet red pepper, chopped</li>
<li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Garnish:</i> 4 eggs, fertilized if you can find them</p>
<p>Discard the soaking water and put the beans and garlic into a Dutch oven with the 8 cups of water. (You don&#8217;t want a narrow pot, because you&#8217;re going to poach 4 eggs in it at the end.)  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until soft, about an hour.  Purée and return to the pot.</p>
<p>Sauté the onions in the corn oil over medium heat until lightly crisp. Add the pork rinds, red pepper, and black pepper, and stir for a few minutes.  Scrape everything into the soup pot, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.  Season with salt.</p>
<p>When ready to serve, raise the heat to medium.  Carefully break the 4 eggs into different spots of the pot, where you see bubbles forming, then cover, and let poach for several minutes.  Carefully ladle into bowls and serve immediately.</p>
<p>Sopa de Frijoles is terrific&#8211;and just one of a vast repertoire of traditional Nicaraguan soups.  Stay tuned, for example, for August 27&#8242;s post on Nicaragua&#8217;s  famous Corn Island Crab Soup, celebrating the abolition of slavery in 1841 by order of England&#8217;s Queen Victoria and Mosquitia&#8217;s King Robert Charles Frederick.</p>

<p>From Turkish <em>cacik </em>cometh Bulgarian <em>tarator, </em>hallelujah!</p>
<p>In Franco Spain, Alice B. Toklas, lover of Gertrude Stein, took up a culinary mystery.  After sampling glorious bowls of gazpacho and not discovering  their origin, she rose to the challenge.  Comparing likenesses among Spanish <i>gazpacho</i>, Polish <i>chlodnik</i>, Turkish <i>cacik, </i>Greek [and Bulgarian] <i>tarata, </i>she crowed  in her 1954 cookbook “from murder to detection is not far. And here is a note on tracking a soup to its source…I came to the conclusion that recipes through conquests and occupations have travelled far.”</p>
<p>Her instincts were excellent; her conclusions suspect:  “Had the Poles passed the recipe to their enemy the Turks at the siege of Vienna or had it been brought back to Poland much earlier than that from Turkey or Greece?  Or had it been brought back by a crusader from Turkey?  Had it gone to Sicily from Greece and then to Spain?  It is a subject to be pursued.”  Talk about being off the mark.  But, hey, I also have made some really boneheaded guesses about the migration of recipes.  It’s nice to be in this fine woman’s company.</p>
<p>But, speaking of Bulgaria, let’s talk about the magic combination of cool cucumbers and yogurt that Alice observed in <i>cacik</i> and<i> tarata&#8211;</i>that are now staples of the Turkish and Balkan peninsulas.</p>
<p>Okay, still a best guess, but cukes and yogurt likely found each other in ancient times in southern India, where cukes were first cultivated, milk cultured, and<i> raita</i> born.  Ancient Greece soon cultivated both—and had lots of commerce with its sometime enemies Turkey (Troy) and Iran (Persia).   However the concept spread in ancient times, it is sure that Greece has had its <i>tzatziki</i>; Turkey its <i>cacik</i>; and Persia its <i>mast-o kheeyar </i>literally for ages.  And as noted  last week with <i>supa topcheta, </i>Ottoman Turks carried their cuisine to the far reaches of their empire: Bulgarians, Macedonians, Albanians, Serbians all have their own versions.</p>
<p><strong>Turkish <i>cacik</i> </strong>(for 4-6 people on a hot summer night)</p>
<p>C<i>acik</i> (pronounced Ja-JEEK) is, in fact, a salad…a <i>meze </i>dip…and, with a little cold water, a soup.  It means “everything green” as the basic white cucumber and yogurt combo is larded with herbs, often mint, dill, and thyme.  And it’s usually served in a small cup, almost as a drink to sip, to accompany a meal (scrumptious with grilled lamb, kebabs, etc.).  Here’s a good, representative recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 large cucumber, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon white grape or apple vinegar</li>
<li>2 cups plain yoghurt</li>
<li>3 Tablespoons water</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>3 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons dill, chopped</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons mint, chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>In a blender, puree the cucumber and garlic, then liquefy.  Toss in the dill, mint, salt, water, oil, and yogurt and blend on high.  Refrigerate until ice cold.  When ready to serve, traditionally as part of the main meal, pour into very small bowls and top with a drizzle of olive oil and/or a pinch of ground sumac.</p>
<p><strong>Bulgarian</strong> <strong><i>tarator </i></strong>(for  4-6 people)</p>
<p>So what’s all the fuss about Bulgarian <i>tarator</i>, if it’s just a variation of <i>cacik</i>?  The fuss, in fact, is the amazingness of Bulgarian yogurt.  On Bulgarian farms, whole milk is fermented with live <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</i>—instead of the usual <i>Streptococcus thermophilus</i>&#8211;and is further cultured by micro-organisms that are naturally present in the farmyard.  Alas, because of these special conditions, you can’t duplicate its creamy tartness, even if you use a  <i>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </i>culture with your processed milk.  But do use the highest quality yogurt you can.  <i>Tarator</i> is lighter, cleaner, more tart than <i>cacik</i> and is served in big bowls as a first course.  Some will serve it as a starter to Easter dinner; most consume it, and often, during the hot summer.  Maestro Kurt Mazur uses the following representative recipe for his favorite soup:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cucumbers, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
<li>½ cup water</li>
<li>4 cups excellent quality plain yogurt</li>
<li>½  teaspoon salt (or more&#8211;taste to season)</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons dill, chopped</li>
</ul>
<p>Garnish:  ground walnuts (these are traditional although the maestro prefers toasted almond slices)</p>
<p>In a blender, puree the cucumber and garlic, then liquefy.  Toss in the water, yogurt, salt, and dill, and mix well.  Refrigerate til ice cold.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with freshly ground walnut.</p>

<p>Back in 2010, my son Bill moved his family to Sofia, Bulgaria, his first assignment as a foreign service officer.  I was over the moon&#8211;a 3-hour direct flight from Paris to my 4 grandchildren.  And there they all were, on the slopes of Mount Vitosha, just minutes in one direction to ski, in another direction to the fabulous 13th century Boyana Church, in another to a charming local restaurant for Bulgarian home cooking.</p>
<p>Who ever heard of Bulgarian cuisine?  I hadn&#8217;t and was eager to see what a complex ancient history, 500 years of Ottoman rule, and 50 years of Soviet-led communism had done to the food.</p>
<p>Famous worldwide for its yogurt (<em>kiselo miyako) </em>and its brined white cheese (<em>sirenye), </em>Bulgarian dishes are curiously heavy with new world foods&#8211;tomatoes, chili peppers (and paprika, the powdered version), beans, and potatoes&#8211;reputedly because, unlike suspicious Europeans, the Turks practically grabbed them out of Colombus&#8217; hands and lavished them throughout their their empire.</p>
<p>The result?  Excellent and distinctive food&#8230;and, of course, soups.  In the weeks ahead, as I try to figure out how to revamp soupsong.com, I like to share some recipes that I&#8217;ll be adding to the new site.  First up:  Supa Topcheta (Meatball Soup), a traditional family favorite and staple of school cafeterias.  Adapted from &#8220;Mother Linda&#8221; Forristal&#8217;s <strong>Bulgarian Rhapsody. </strong></p>
<p><strong>SUPA TOPCHETA (for 6)</strong></p>
<p>Creamy, tangy, woodsy from the parsley, and with tender meatballs and the bite of carrots&#8211;this is soup for the hungry.  One of the most filling soups I&#8217;ve encountered.  Many recipes add tomatoes (in brackets), and you can convert it from a meal to a substantial course by omitting or halving the pasta.</p>
<ul>
<li>4 scallions, chopped far down into the green</li>
<li>1 medium carrot, diced small</li>
<li>[optional 3 peeled tomatoes, diced small]</li>
<li>4 Tablespoons oil</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
<li>5 cups water</li>
<li></li>
<li> 2/3 pound ground meat</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
<li>4 Tablespoons raw rice</li>
<li>1 egg white (reserve yolk for final assembly)</li>
<li>flour for coating meatballs</li>
<li></li>
<li>[2 or 1 or no nests of angel hair pasta]</li>
<li>1 cup yogurt</li>
<li>1 egg (plus the reserved egg yolk)</li>
<li>1 cup flat parsley, chopped</li>
<li>lemon juice and black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, stir in the scallions, carrots, and salt, then the 2 Tablespoons water.  Cook until the carrots are soft, about 3 minutes.  [If you use tomatoes, you do not need to add the water.]   Stir in the paprika and let it release its flavor into the fat.  Add 5 cups water and bring to a boil</p>
<p>Make the meatballs by mixing well the meat, salt, paprika, rice, and egg white. Pinch off small pieces, roll into balls, and coat with flour, lining the meatballs up on a plate.  When the water is boiling, add the meatballs, one by one; bring back to a boil, then reduce heat to low, partially cover, and cook for 20 minutes.  [If you using the pasta, add 5 minutes before the meatballs are done.]</p>
<p>At this point, you can turn off the heat, cover, and leave for final assembly later.</p>
<p>When ready to serve, beat the yogurt in a bowl and whisk in the eggs.    Reheat the soup, if it has cooled, and stir a quarter cup of the hot liquid into the yogurt&#8211;then a half cup&#8211;then stir the yogurt mixture back into the soup.  This &#8220;zastroika&#8221; method keeps the eggs from getting stringy and makes a lovely consistency.  Keep the soup on low.  Stir in the black pepper, salt to taste, and the chopped parsley.  You may stir in the lemon juice at the end or serve a wedge of lemon with each serving.  Garnish each bowl with chopped scallions.</p>

<p>Almost 5 years since my last post on Halloween 2009. Five years!  A lot of soup under the bridge&#8230;many European, African, and Latin American adventures under my belt&#8230;relocating from Paris back to Washington, DC&#8230;and just now retiring from the day job (!) to what I hope will be a new era for soupsong. The plan?  Nothing less than ditching the old format of soupsong.com and a lot of its content to create Soupedia, a compendium of traditional soup recipes from all time periods and cultures that I hope will largely flow into the site from soup lovers around the world.  And fast, before the globalization of food and custom make us forget these storied traditions. It&#8217;s going to be a long haul, folks, as I figure out 21st century tools and laboriously reprogram the content.  But along the way I hope to tease and tempt you on this blog with stories and recipes I have collected during my long absence.  And what better way to start, now that I&#8217;m back in the poisonous politics of Washington, DC,  than with an 18th century American crab soup from the hand of our first First Lady Martha Washington? Appropriately, I adapted a recipe found in Washington insider Cokie Roberts&#8217; <em>Founding Mothers:  The Women Who Raised Our Nation, </em>credited to Poppy Cannon and Patricia Brooks&#8217; 1968 book of presidential recipes.  It is light and lemony but <em>rich </em>&#8211; and heady with a whiff of sherry to stimulate the appetite.  Need I say it?  PERFECT for these cool spring days.  Don&#8217;t you wish you had a cup right this minute? MARTHA WASHINGTON&#8217;S CRAB SOUP (6 servings)</p>
<ul>
<li>3 eggs, hardboiled</li>
<li>grated rind of one lemon</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1 and 1/2 tablespoons flour</li>
<li>4 cups milk</li>
<li>salt and white pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 cup crabmeat (ideally lump Chesapeake crab, but all crab is good in this)</li>
<li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
<li>1/2 cup dry sherry</li>
<li><em>Garnish: </em>strips of lemon rind and parsley</li>
</ul>
<p>Mash the hardboiled eggs and grated lemon rind together and reserve.  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat, whisk in the flour and blend for a minute or two.  Slowly whisk in the milk, turning up the heat to medium, and bring to a boil.  Whisk in the egg/rind and cook gently for 5 minute to thicken.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.  Right before serving, stir in the heavy cream and crabmeat and bring just to a boil.  Remove from heat, add the sherry, and serve immediately.  Garnish each bowl with a curl of lemon rind and a parsley leaf.</p>

<p>Even so, I was pretty surprised to find the pictured soup in all the London Tesco supermarkets last weekend. &#8220;Witches Brew&#8221; indeed&#8211;rather a pumpkin and tomato puree with bits of blackeyed peas and veggies floating in it.</p>

<p>
Who knew that REAL French onion soup began its life in Lyon?  So declared lyonnais Bernard Chaléat, friend of Catherine (pictured), before we ever arrived:   &#8220;La soupe à l&#8217;oignon est d&#8217;origine lyonnaise!&#8221;  </p>
<p>
Me, I would have put money on its origin in Paris, old standby that its <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/ronion3.html">soupe à l&#8217;oignon</a> has been historically at Les Halles and Montmartre.  And I would have lost.</p>
<p>
Come south with me from Paris to Lyon, at the confluence of the Rhone and Saone rivers&#8211;a town founded as a Roman military colony of Lugdunum in 43 BCE, then rising to prominence from its easy position on major trading routes.  The town nearly backrupted itself buying the gorgeous silks that came over the silk road from China&#8211;to the point that in 1436 Louis XI declared the town should make its own silk&#8230;and in 1536, Francois I gave Lyon the French monopoly.  By the 1750s Lyon had become the silk-weaving capital of Europe.</p>
<p>
What does all this have to do with onion soup?  In fact, onion soup had everything to do with Lyon&#8217;s masses of overworked/underpaid <em>canuts</em> (silk workers).  They worked 18 hours a day; they needed hot, rich, cheap food.  Voila, onion soup poured over stale bread and a little cheese thrown on top.  Probably it started as a way to flavor and enrich the broth of traditional pot-au-feu&#8211;and to use up stale bread.  Then it became a tradition&#8211;and was traditionally served as the last course (if the meal was lucky enough to have several courses) to fill up and warm the bellies of workers on their way back to the looms.</p>
<p>
Crazy, though, that this simple beginning blossomed into today&#8217;s &#8220;gratinée lyonnaise&#8221; that insists on the addition of egg yolks and&#8230;port!  Don&#8217;t ask me how a red fortified wine from the Douro Valley in Portugal found its way into this soup.  In any case, you can see the upshot in the picture, under Catherine&#8217;s smiling face at <em>Les Fines Gueules bouchon</em> in the St. Jean district of Lyon. And you should taste it too.  Despite my doubts, it&#8217;s marvelous.  The chopped onions pretty much dissolve into browned richness; the egg yolks make it silky; and the port, at the end, envelopes you in heady fragrance.</p>
<p>
Gratinée lyonnaise (for 4)</p>
<ul>
<li>2 Tablespoons butter; 2 Tablespoons oil</li>
<li>4 medium onions, chopped</li>
<li>6 cups beef stock (ideally, broth from your pot-au-feu)</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>2-3 egg yolks</li>
<li>1/2 cup red port, medium dry</li>
<li>stale sliced French bread, toasted in a slow oven until crisp through</li>
<li>1/2-1 cup grated Comté cheese (Gruyére or Swiss is also fine, though Comté is more local to the area)</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat the butter and oil over medium heat, toss in the onions, and sauté, stirring, for a few minutes.  Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let cook until the onions have browned on the bottom.  Stir the browned bits through the onion, then pour in the stock, taste for seasoning, and heat to boiling.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for at least 30 minutes.  The onions should have mostly melted away.</p>
<p>
Toast the stale French bread slices.  Grate the cheese.  Have the egg yolks and port handy.</p>
<p>
When ready to serve, beat the egg yolks into the port and stir into the simmering pot.  Let thicken and get silky for about 5 minutes.  Place the toasted croutons into flat serving plates.  Ladle the soup on top.  Sprinkle each serving with as much or as little cheese as you like&#8211;but err on the light side.  Such a relief to not be confronted with the Parisian throat-choking plate of cheese on top.  You can serve the soup immediately or run the plates under the broiler for a quick crust. </p>
<p>
As a last note, many thanks to Bernard and Anne Chaléat, who gave Catherine and me such an extraordinary tour of the city and its Roman aqueduct, then happily fed us in their beautiful home&#8211;all the best food of Lyon, culinary capital of France. </p>
<p>
Finally, do I recommend <em>Les Fines Gueules</em>, founded by Franck Perrin and Ludovic Rouviere in 2002?  Certainement!  Lovely atmosphere and excellent food.<br />

<p>This silly drawing is from &#8220;Etiquette,&#8221; one of W. S. Gilbert&#8217;s &#8220;Bab Ballads,&#8221; which recounts the plight of two proper but very shipwrecked Englishmen. Alas, they have not been properly introduced, so they can not exchange a word and must resolutely stay on their own side of a tiny island. Peter Gray lives on the oyster side of the island, though he hates oysters; instead, &#8220;turtle and his mother were the only things he loved.&#8221; Somers lives on the turtle side of the island, though he hates turtle meat.  And, tragedy!, &#8220;he had often eaten oysters, but had never had enough.&#8221; Starvation looms&#8230;no way around the proprieties&#8230;the end is near&#8230;then suddenly&#8230;. Well, it&#8217;s complicated. I encourage you to read <a href="http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/bab_ballads/html/etiquette.html">&#8220;Etiquette&#8221;</a> for some rather unexpected life lessons.</p>
<p>Lesson #1, of course:  let nothing stand in the way of eating oysters.  And like it or not, last week&#8217;s homage to oyster soup was father to this week&#8217;s lesson on <em>l&#8217;ostréiculture</em>&#8211;oysters in France.</p>
<p>
THE HISTORY</p>
<ul>
<li>When Julius Caesar and his legions of Romans discovered <em>Ostrea edulis</em>, the flat, &#8220;plated&#8221; European oyster, along the 2000 miles of French coastline, they flipped. But when these became society&#8217;s darlings in the 19th century, the plated oyster virtually disappeared from overfishing and disease.  Oh, they are SUCH a treat&#8230;and so expensive.  I buy the biggest ONE I can find every Saturday I&#8217;m in town (the meat doesn&#8217;t get tougher with age, just bigger) and look forward to eating it all day long.</li>
<li>In 1868, story goes, the good ship <em>Le Morlaisien</em> ran into a storm on the way to England with a cargo of live Portugaise oysters, <em>Crassostrea angulata</em>, and took refuge in the Gironde estuary. Its cargo was heavy, rotting, stank&#8211;the captain finally got permission to dump them overboard&#8230;where they promptly revived and took over the place.  These yummy &#8220;cup&#8221; oysters, originally brought from Asia by Portuguese traders, turned France for a second time into oyster paradise.</li>
<li>Alas, in the 1960s, disease struck both Portuguese and European oysters along the French coast&#8211;and France was once again bereft of oysters.  Enter the &#8220;creuse&#8221; Pacific oyster, <em>Crassostrea gigas</em>, imported from Japan and from British Columbia and carefully introduced and cultivated.  The comeback was quick, and today <em>l&#8217;ostréiculture</em> is a dazzling success once again.  According to expert John McCabe, some 3,400 French oyster growers produced an estimated 518 million Euros in sales in 2005. </li>
</ul>
<p>
THE OYSTERS:  7 regions&#8211;same mostly creuse oyster, all distinctively different.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Normandy</strong>, from Belgium to Mont Saint Michel along the English channel:  the little niche areas of cultivation here produce a crisp, refreshing, and salty oyster. <em>Huître spéciale d&#8217;Isigny</em> is a particular hottie.</li>
<li><strong>Northern Brittany</strong>, from Mont Saint Michel to Brest along the English channel:  think darling and remote little Cancale where Matisse painted and where I bought my little oyster knife, which I&#8217;ve used on every oyster since 1994.  It is a haven for fresh and sparkling creuses; rich and many-layered plates; and giant wild ones (<em>sauvages</em>), which grow very large indeed.
<li><strong>Southern Brittany</strong>, from the Bay of Douarnenez to the Loire River on the Atlantic Ocean: okay, we&#8217;ve turn the western corner of France south onto the straight Atlantic coast, but cultivation here is complex, with bays, rivers, and streams serving for beds.  Take Belon oysters.  *sigh*  Oh yes, let&#8217;s take them all.  These are plate oysters that are coddled and overfed in the brackish waters of the Belon river until they are shamefully plump and exotically tasty.  Farther south, creuse oysters undergo similar coddling in phyto-plankton-rich seas:  they turn green and have a hazelnut taste.  Others whose beds stick far out into the Atlantic are fresh and salty, like kissing the sea on the lips.</li>
<li><strong>West Central France</strong>, from the Loire to the Charentes river on the Atlantic:  Now we have entered the land of <em>Claires</em> cultivation&#8211;where oysters are moved from their seabeds into special basins for <em>affinage</em>, getting clean, getting fatter, gaining depth of flavor.  Think Ile de Ré, La Rochelle, and Fouras.</li>
<li><strong>Marennes-Oléron</strong>, from the Charentes to the Gironde river on the Atlantic:  This area takes <em>affinage</em> to a whole new place.  This is where young oysters are moved from the sea to medieval salt basins that have been converted to shallow pools and flooded with nutritious waters.  Here the oysters cleanse themselves of mud and sand; they fatten; they enrich themselves; they even learn how to keep their shells shut, so they stay alive longer in the marketplace&#8230;.  It&#8217;s in these pools that the fresh, salty taste of ocean oysters turn sweet, aromatic, and rich.  It&#8217;s here too that emerald green oysters are produced on a Blue navicula phyto-plankton diet.  These are oysters for chewing.</li>
<li><strong>Arcachon</strong>, from the Gironde to Spain on the Atlantic coast:  More of the same in terms of technique&#8211;the <em>claire</em> cultivation&#8211;but of both Japanese creuse oysters AND European plate oysters.  Arcachon is equally important in producing baby oysters&#8211;which none of the other regions are able to do.  Any oysters harvested in May and June will be milky, filled with either sperm or eggs, in the millions.
<li><strong>French Mediterranean</strong>, just in the Languedoc region:  unlikely and always in danger of too-high temperatures and not enough tidal action, <em>Bassin de Thau</em>, a lake between Bezier and Monpellier, cultivates absolutely scrumptious creuse and plate oysters&#8211;quite different in taste from their French brethren.  P.S.  Corsica, part of the French state, is also a cultivator of oysters, though I have never seen any in French markets.</li>
</ol>
<p>
SO, if all this information has made you lust after oysters as much as me, run to the store to buy some, as I plan to do, then make the recipe below&#8211;another one adapted from Louis Anne Rothert&#8217;s <em>Soups of France</em>, this one from Marennes-Oléron at Charentes.  She calls it <em>Les Trois Glorieuses des Charentes&#8221; as it combines 3 of the 4 specialties of Charentes:  Marennes oysters, the aperitif <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineau_des_Charentes">Pineau des Charentes</a>, butter, and cognac.</p>
<p>
THE RECIPE:  LES TROIS GLOREUSES DES CHARENTES (per serving)<br />
8-10 small oysters (or 3-4 big ones cut in chunks), juice reserved<br />
1 Tablespoon butter<br />
1 shallot, minced<br />
1 garlic clove, minced<br />
3/4 cup oyster juice (add fish stock or clam juice if needed)<br />
1/2 cup heavy cream<br />
sprinkling of white pepper<br />
garnish:  1 Tablespoon Pineau des Charentes, minced parsley, a few thin circles of leek</p>
<p>
Sauté the shallots in the butter over low heat, then add the garlic and stir in for a few minutes.  Add the oyster juice and cook down on low heat for 5 minutes.  Add the cream and bring to a simmer.  When ready to serve, add the oysters and remove from the heat after 10 seconds or so, when you see the edges curl.  Taste for seasoning&#8211;you probably won&#8217;t need salt if your oysters are fresh, but a little grind of white pepper is good.  Ladle into your soup plate, garnish with the parsley and leeks, and sprinkle the Pineau over the top.</p>
<p>
Dig in&#8211;you deserve it!</p>
<p>
Please note:  most of my information came straight from John McCabe&#8217;s superb <a href="http://www.oysters.us/">Oysters.US</a>. </p>

<p>I woke up this morning thinking about soup.  Still too early for Paris to turn on the heat so, with all my casement windows open, I was double wrapped in down and still had freezing feet.  Another sign of the season &#8212; old friends from early soupsong.com days are checking in.  All of it feels good, heading into days of kicking through horsechestnut leaves after work, anticipating the warmth and goodness of the soup kettle just steps away. </p>
<p>Do you know this book?  Lois Anne Rothert published <em>The Soups of France</em> in 2002.  It&#8217;s a beauty.  Forget about haute cuisine, formal restaurant service, and, in the words of 19th century gourmand Alexandre-Balthazar-Laurent Grimod de la Reynière, that &#8220;soup is to dinner what the portico or the peristyle is to an edifice. That is to say, not only is it the first part, but it should be conceived in such a way as to give an exact idea of the feast, very nearly as the overture to an opera should announce the quality of the whole work.&#8221; </p>
<p>Forget all that.  In this book, soup IS the edifice; it IS the feast.  Rothert focuses specifically on &#8220;big&#8221; meal-in-a-pot soups that are tied to specific Franch regions.  <em>Soupe au Pistou</em> from Provence.  <em>Garbure</em> from South West France.  <em>Matelote</em> from Normandie and the Loire. <em>Cotriade</em> from Brittany.  She says that, at this point in time, her book is &#8220;an essential work of safekeeping.&#8221;  And it&#8217;s true:  I rarely find these soups on a menu anywhere in France.  They are disappearing.  And you know I&#8217;ve been looking.  </p>
<p>
Likewise, Lois Rothert herself is hard to track down.  She permits a small smiling picture of herself on the flyleaf of the book, proudly wearing her age with frazzled hair, oversized glasses, and an open collared jeans shirt&#8211;but is otherwise mostly invisible in the book and on the web.  Fluent in French; educated at <a href="http://www.lavarenne.com/">La Varenne</a>; restauranteuse for 7 years in Fort Wayne, Indiana; mother of 4 children; winters in Indiana and summers outside Seattle in Cle Elum&#8211;that&#8217;s about it.  But she knows France, knows food, and has produced a book that sings.  Just look at that bowl of <em>Soupe Locmariaquer</em>, fat with oysters and smoked ham, from Brittany.  I&#8217;ve adapted the grandmother&#8217;s recipe that she sweet-talked from the owner of the <a href="http://monsite.orange.fr/lescale56/">Hotel L&#8217;Escale</a> at tiny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locmariaquer">Locmariaquer</a>.  This version is much simpler&#8211;basically the classic French potato soup that every housewife used to have on the burner&#8230;then stuffed with fresh oysters and crisp lardons right before serving.</p>
<p>
Soupe  Locmariaquer:  Soupe Bonne Femme with Oysters and Crisp Ham Bits (for 6)</p>
<p>
1 Tablespoon butter<br />
4 leeks, cleaned and washed, then sliced (up into the green) into a 1/3-inch dice (1 and 1/2 cups)<br />
1/2 cup diced onion<br />
4-5 potatoes, peeled and diced (3 cups)<br />
6 cups hot milk<br />
sprigs of fresh rosemary, thyme, and a half bay leaf<br />
1 teaspoon salt<br />
1 Tablespoons butter<br />
1/4 pound lardons (or thick bacon), cut into 1-inch pieces<br />
24 medium-sized oysters (at least!  This would be a measly 4 per bowl)<br />
2 Tablespoons butter enrichment<br />
Garnish:  thinly sliced leeks and toasted croutes</p>
<p>
Heat 1 T. butter in a saucepan over medium low heat, stir in the leeks and onions, and sweat slowly, covered, until they are soft, but not brown. Add the potatoes and hot milk with the salt and herbs, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes, covered, until the potatoes are soft.  </p>
<p>
While the soup is cooking, saute the lardons/bacon in a Tablespoon of butter over medium heat until the fat has rendered.  Drain on paper towels and reserve.</p>
<p>
Shuck the oysters, carefully reserving the juice and strain through cheese cloth if necessary.</p>
<p>
When the soup is done, remove the herbs and add the oyster liquor and 2 Tablespoons of butter enrichment. Taste to see if it needs salt&#8211;it may well not, since the oyster juice is salty&#8211;and maybe grind some white pepper into it. Mash the soup to thicken it with the potatoes, without completely creaming it.  It should be lumpy.</p>
<p>
When ready to serve, slide the oysters into the simmering broth (15 or so seconds is enough to plump them).  Stir in the crisp ham bits.  Ladle into bowls and top with thinly sliced leeks and croutons on the side.</p>
<p>
Bottom line: if you want to grasp French foodways and see right into the heart of the French stomach,  run don&#8217;t walk to your local online used bookstore.  Lois Rothert&#8217;s <em>The Soups of France</em> is pricey, but all treasures are.</p>

As I stepped off my train in Vichy&#8217;s exquisite station, I had all sorts of pre-conceptions.  Yes, yes, I would find the perfect building or monument to capture the shame of Pétain&#8217;s collaborationist government with the 3rd Reich&#8230;and somehow it would also capture the long history of aristocratic pleasuring at Vichy&#8217;s thermal springs.  And, oh yes, I would dine in elegance, somewhere, on native son Louis Diat&#8217;s <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/rpotato5.html">vichyssoise</a> and capture that on film for you too.</p>
<p>
Oh well.</p>
<p>
Please know that Vichy is an extraordinary town&#8211;a little down at the heels, maybe, despite the gilding, the eye-popping statuary, the exotic moorish architecture, the parks and river walks.  But still dedicated to pleasure, as it has been since Emperor Napoleon III took its cool, metallic and also hot, stinky waters in the 1860s for his health.  Horseracing, casinos, golf, casinos, theater, casinos, opera, casinos, and <a href="http://www2.ville-vichy.fr/en/sante/index.html?http%3A//www2.ville-vichy.fr/en/sante/31.html">temples to health and beauty</a> that clothe then divest you of impossibly thick white terry robes between your massages, baths, languid slumps in the hammam, you get the picture.   </p>
<p>
I had only two commitments:  1.  Meeting foodie friend Catherine for a sensational lunch at  Brasserie du Casino on Sunday.  2.  Finding a local soup that would set your hair on fire, preferably a creation of chef Diat.  First stop on Saturday morning, Brasserie du Casino&#8211;to establish that I would find a great soup there to order next day.  <em>Absolument non.</em>  There it was again&#8211;the only offering that same old bland <a href="http://soupsong.com/blog/2009/08/whereve-i-been-captured-by-aliens/">gaspacho</a> that is everywhere.  From that point on, it was Experience the Town and Find a Soup, all day long.  </p>
<p>
How about in the oldest part of town, past Mme. de Sévigné&#8217;s house, where Pétain held his cabinet meetings, and twisting down from the heights on narrow streets to the river and the elegant pavilion housing the source of Celestin waters?  Nope.  Lots of restos, none served soup.</p>
<p>
How about along the formal Parc des Sources, bristling with the priciest boutiques and most expensive restaurants?  Um, no.  No soup.</p>
<p>
The center of town, cachinking from the casinos and oompah-pahing from the bandstand? <em>Non.</em></p>
<p>
Surely at the Grand Marché, a stadium of over a hundred food markets of every stripe?  <em>Rien.</em></p>
<p>
In the end, the giant Les Quatre Chemins shopping center/casino complex to the north of town saved me:  <em>Soupe d&#8217;avocat froide au citron vert, brunoise de concombre</em> in its cool <a href="http://www.casino4chemins.com/fr/Restauration.html">panoramic restaurant</a> just a winding staircase up from the heated, neonized casino.  You can see how good it was.  Thick and creamy; mild (of course, it&#8217;s French) with only a hint of lime and tarragon; tiny chunks of cucumber and sweet red pepper, a drizzle of fruity olive oil.  And, you know, there it was: a 21st century version of Diat&#8217;s vichyssoise&#8211;his classic cold leek/potato soup whipped with avocado and sweetly garnished.  Make it yourself from my recipe <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/ravocad3.html">Colombian Avocado Vichyssoise </a>.</p>
<p>
So, a perfect and very full vacation in less than 2 days.  And if I hadn&#8217;t been scouring the town for a good soup, I never would have stumbled into this pictured evidence of local wedding customs.  Is it just me, or is this custom a little gender bending?</p>
