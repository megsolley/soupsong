<p>Yes, it LOOKS like there&#8217;s &#8220;Pain in the Bourse&#8221; in Paris, and today&#8217;s national strike to draw attention to France&#8217;s part of worldwide international fiscal misery would support that, but in fact <em>Le Pain de la Bourse </em>is a darling little cafe just across the street, as you can see, from the Bourse&#8211;and its name means &#8220;The Bread of the Bourse&#8221; (and not the kind of &#8220;bread&#8221; that means money).  </p>
<p>
Do you love it?  The heart of French financial markets is located in the Palais Brongniart, neoclassically built in the over-the-top 19th century by Emperor Napoleon&#8217;s architect Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart.  Why did Napoleon commission Brongniart to build it?  Because he loved how Brongniart had designed the layout for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a>, now, of course, the revered home of (sigh) Jim Morrison of the Doors and zillions of other really more interesting people.  Not that Jim isn&#8217;t interesting.  </p>
<p>
So Dominique (pictured) and I arranged to meet to discuss the state of things.  Obama&#8217;s first days as President&#8211;she&#8217;d gone to the inauguration party at Hôtel de Ville, with lots of noise, interminable lines to get drinks, but high joy from beginning to end; I&#8217;d stayed home and watched first French TF1 then CNN with champagne and a friend.  Then an embassy bookclub trip she is arranging to Orleans to follow in the footsteps of Joan of Arc, after reading Mark Twain&#8217;s fictionalized biography on same that he (wrongly) described as his &#8220;greatest work.&#8221;  An Opera Comique performance that we couldn&#8217;t get tickets to. The upcoming national strike that would shut down metro, regional and neighborhood trains and flights across the country today. &#8220;Let&#8217;s try <em>Le Pain de la Bourse</em>,&#8221; she said.  And so we did.</p>
<p>
It was such a cute little place.  Menu of the day on the chalkboard.  11,80 euros ($17) for soupe de potiron (pumpkin soup), open-face sandwiches of ham and gouda cheese on Poilâne-style bread, and salad. </p>
<p>
We agreed the soup was terrific, but not for the reasons you&#8217;d suppose.  It was so pure and simple&#8230;so French.  Pumpkin cooked in seasoned water with a little mince of parsley, then pureed.  That&#8217;s it.  It&#8217;s not meant to bowl you over; not meant to challenge your palate with different flavors and textures and colors; not meant to fill you up.  Soup in France, for the most part, is, in the words of Auguste Escoffier (that early 20th century &#8220;king of chefs and chef of kings&#8221;) designed to &#8220;put the heart at ease, calm down the violence of hunger, eliminate the tension of the day, and awaken and refine the appetite&#8221; </p>
<p>
And it did.  Markets are failing.  Davos is dour.  Strikes are pending.  But Dominique and I sat in the shadow of the French Bourse (Per Bloomberg, &#8220;France’s CAC 40 retreated 2.2 percent&#8221; that day) and felt as if our hearts were at ease, the violence of hunger had been calmed, the tension of the day just evaporated, and our appetites were awakened and refined&#8211;which was too bad, when you look at the rest of the plate with its little cheese tartine, its little ham tartine, and a big mass of mesclun salad, not very well dressed.  Oh well.</p>
<p>
All things considered, it was a very enjoyable lunch indeed and we recommend the restaurant for its breakfast, brunch, and lunch:<br />
<em>Le Pain de la Bourse</em><br />
33, rue Vivienne<br />
75002 Paris<br />
telephone:  01.42.36.76.02</p>
<p>
And if you&#8217;re hankering after true French housewife pumpkin soup, please take a look at the original recipe of my marvelous Touraine professor of many years ago, Mme. Marie-Josie Diacre, at <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/rpumpki4.html">Soupsong&#8217;s Soupe au potiron</a>.  I cannot help be reminded, during this perilous fiscal time, that Jack Sprat also turned to pumpkins in times of trouble.</p>

<p>
Friend Elizabeth found the reference on the first page of this week&#8217;s <em>Figaro Scope</em>, which tells you what&#8217;s hot hot hot in Paris for the coming week.  And right on the first page, first item for restaurants, was <a href="http://www.lebarasoupes.com/">Le Bar à soupes</a>.  <em>Courez-y!</em>, it said:  &#8220;Run there!&#8221;  So Christine and I did the very next day for lunch&#8211;jumping on metro line 1 and off at Bastille, closing our eyes to resist the temptations of the fabulous January sales on Faubourg St. Antoine, then hooking a left on Rue de Charonne in the 11th.</p>
<p>
Whew, we were just about the first customers, and it was a good thing since the tiny place filled up to bursting in the next quarter hour.  Who knew this was a Paris institution?  </p>
<p>
Anne-Catherine Bley (pictured) opened it 9 years ago with a single concept and hasn&#8217;t changed it one bit since then:  Six freshly made, homemade soups every day but Sundays and holidays, 12 noon to 3, then 6:30 to 11pm. For 5 euros, you can sit down (or take out) a big bowl of soup, a fabulous seedy roll, and a sparkling carafe of water spiced with fresh lime.  OR, for 9,90 euros you can settle down with the &#8220;formule.&#8221;  This last means 1) a big bowl of soup with bread; 2) a choice of really delectable cheese, salad, or dessert; and 3) a glass of wine or coffee or tea.  Carafe d&#8217;eau, of course, if you ask for it&#8211;it&#8217;s required by law for all French restaurants.</p>
<p>
I got the <em>pois chiche à l&#8217;orientale</em>&#8211;a nice chunky little soup with chickpeas, tomatoes, a little pepper, and the surprise of plumped sultanas; Christine settled on the <em>crème de carottes </em>.  We chose; we took a window seat; we were served; and we had the best time soaking it all in.  Attractive and slim Anne-Catherine bustling over her soups like a mother hen (haven&#8217;t I always told you that the more soup you eat, the slenderer you&#8217;ll be?).  Young, enthusiastic serveurs.  Attractive setting with down lights; charcoal granite floor; blond, stainless, and glass counter crowned with dramatic flowers and revealing the soups of the day like an artist&#8217;s palette; and large oil portraits on white walls of a big fat turnip, a fennel, a tomato, and a beet.  In the back room, racks of newspapers and magazines stood by to charm and stimulate the clientele.  Because this wasn&#8217;t a snooty, stylish crowd at all.  This was tweedy professors, and students in jeans and back packs, and young arty professionals with laptops.  Possibly the 21st century de Beauvoir was in the back room arguing and slurping and writing.</p>
<p>
The soups are very nice and very French and very much in season.  This week, lots of creamy vegetable soups&#8211;carrot; red pepper; mushroom; broccoli; pumpkin; chestnuts; peas&#8211;sometimes spiced with a little mint or citrus, sometimes smooshed with the housewife&#8217;s favorite soup cheese, La vache qui rit.  Lentil soups. Some surprises of borshch or celery with blue cheese.</p>
<p>
Do I recommend this place?  You know I do.  Anne-Catherine delivers the goods:  she says, <em>Car une soupe c’est bon, c’est simple et c’est surtout pas triste ! </em>, or &#8220;Because a soup is good, is simple, and above all never sad.&#8221;  </p>
<p>
Courez-y!<br />

<p>My last day in Turkey, *sob*, and it&#8217;s off to the neighborhood resto for an Ottoman feast &#8212; the splendid <a href="http://www.altinsiskebapcisi.com">Altinsis</a>. We&#8217;re welcomed sequentially by some 8 smiling men into a large golden room, spangled with beams from the setting sun through its panoramic windows. The gal in charge of the children&#8217;s playroom is a little wide-eyed when she spots the Solley 4 trooping in her door, and we are immediately marched off to the table assigned to parents, where we can monitor kid shenanigans through the glass wall separating us.  We kick back with a sigh and study the menu.  It&#8217;s formidible and told in pictures&#8211;some 93 of them.</p>
<p>
We can&#8217;t resist the stuffed grapeleaves, the pide, the kebaps, and a bunch of tasty meze&#8211;but take a look at the incredible pictured <em>Eksili Ufak Köfte</em> soup.  It&#8217;s a fragrant and spicy broth thick with bits of tender lamb and tomatoes.  But how about those exquisite and rich dumplings filling the bowl&#8211;and how about the fact that they&#8217;re punctuated by a large dark splash of heady mint oil?  Quite spectacular in appearance and what an exciting combination of flavors.  We&#8217;d love a recipe!</p>
<p>
We felt as pampered as the women in Altinsis&#8217; pictured artwork, and we highly recommend the soup and the restaurant:<br />

<p>Back in September, when I was hyperventilating over the beauty of my just one-year-old granddaughter Rosalind in Seattle, I got taken out to lunch by the urbanspoon.com guys, where daughter Meg had been working part time. Don&#8217;t know about <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com">urbanspoon.com</a>? You should. Among other amazing things that it does, it lets you use the GPS on your ipod to locate the closest, say, SOUP restaurant to your own two feet at that moment, then draws you a map to get there and lets you read reviews about it before you walk through the door. I tried it out on Patrick&#8217;s ipod&#8211;incredible and incredibly easy. Plus I got the t-shirt. &#8220;Take it to Paris,&#8221; Adam said, &#8220;we&#8217;d love to urbanspoon that city too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when Ana suggested we Pudlo on Friday night, I finally remembered to pop the t-shirt in my bag for a trial spin.</p>
<p>Pudlo?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the brilliant Gilles Pudlowski&#8217;s restaurant guide of Paris. Ana and I go Pudloing the way Oscar Wilde&#8217;s Algy Moncrieff goes Bunburying.</p>
<p>La Gorille Blanc is a Pudlo &#8220;Special Favorite.&#8221; It&#8217;s in the 7th Arrondissement on the Left Bank, within spitting distance of the great Bon Marche department store and food emporium. Bernard Arény has made a truly sweet spot of it, bringing in a great chef with a fabulous menu, and consecrating the place to <em>Flocon de neige</em> (Snowflake), the astonishing albino gorilla who was captured in equitorial Guinea by the Fang tribe in 1966 and thence transported to the Barcelona zoo. Snowflake lived to the great age of 40 and fathered some 21 babies, none of them albinos. When Arény visited him in Barcelona, it was love at first sight.</p>
<p>The restaurant is tiny, charged with a warm, rich, and silvergleaming atmosphere, and hung with portraits of Snowflake. Ana and I are the first people in the place (typical Americans&#8211;&#8221;only&#8221; 7:30 pm) and it&#8217;s a good thing, cause we cheerfully go about making asses out of ourselves. &#8220;Ha ha ha,&#8221; says Ana, &#8220;My friend is going to write up this evening&#8217;s meal on the Internet, is it okay to use the camera?&#8221; &#8220;Ha ha ha, oh yes, that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; says the darling waitress. M. Arény is in the background, very chic in his brick red shirt and black trousers. Ana takes a picture of me tucking the Urbanspoon t-shirt under my jacket and posing next to a picture of Snowflake climbing a ladder. Nope, can&#8217;t see the logo. How about putting the t-shirt logo on top of the photo? <em>Non, non, non!</em> M. Areny rushes up with a different and great photo of Snowflake&#8217;s head and takes over the stage managing of the whole shot, pictured. We love it and hope you do too. And we&#8217;re all relieved that we got THAT out of the way.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;ve ordered. We&#8217;re embarked on a lovely pichet of St. Emilion Bordeaux. And oh la la, the soup arrives and it&#8217;s gorgeous! <em>Un velouté de chataignes en cappuccino aux cèpes séchés</em>, or creamy chestnut soup with a porcini mushroom emulsion, splashed with paprika and topped with chervil. Oh my. Ana and I both want to dive in head first, but the staff springs into photography support. I take a picture with the flash and it doesn&#8217;t do the dish justice. Candlesticks appear from all directions and we end up with the photo you see. It DOES do the <em>look</em> of the soup justice, but not the taste and feel. The soup is light, rich, and sweet but goes into palate overdrive when paired with the musky froth of deeply flavored mushrooms.  Something to suck through your teeth and savor in small swallows, if only you had that kind of self control.</p>
<p>And the rest of the dinner follows suit, Ana so happy with <em>la terrine de champignon à la crème d&#8217;ail</em> (mushroom terrine) and both of us with <em>le fricassé de lapin et oignons aux raisins secs </em>(stewed rabbit), not to mention the superb desserts&#8211;price for each of us, including wine and tip, 45 euros.  Not bad!</p>
<p>We highly recommend it: LA GORILLE BLANC<br />
11 bis, rue Chomel<br />
75007 Paris<br />
01.45.49.04.54</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll work on developing a recipe for this marvelous chestnut soup, but in the meantime, if you simply must have chestnut soup today, try the much heartier <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/rchestnu.html">Hungarian recipe for Creamy Chestnut and Smoked Ham Soup</a> on my website.</p>

<p>
Such a miserable day. Cold rain coming down in buckets. Clearly time to execute my fave rainy lunchtime activity: Dash to the metro at <em>Place Concorde</em>, jump up two stops on Line 1, and worm my way underground to the Carrousel entrance of the Louvre. I&#8217;ve got the Bronzes Français exhibit on my mind. But as I start up the escalator to the Richelieu wing, I&#8217;m assailed by a tantalyzing aroma &#8230;and spot a café just right there on the balcony. No harm in seeing what&#8217;s on the menu.</p>
<p>
Oh my, Bugs Bunny would be excited:  a steaming cauldron of <em>Crème Crécy</em> for 4,20 euro a shot. I can&#8217;t resist. There you see it&#8211;carrots times a thousand; piping hot; the first sip so sweet that you think the Louvre must surely be shopping at the local bio farm; a dash of white pepper, undersalted, tiny little sprigs of curly parsley. It&#8217;s exactly like so many French household soups: plain, pure, light, yet filling your belly and warming you up.</p>
<p>
Carrots in France.  Totally interesting.  The French didn&#8217;t love them until well into the Middle Ages (originally from Afghanistan, they came in red, purple, black, yellow, and white varietals and weren&#8217;t hybridized to beta-carotene orange til the Dutch got their hands on them).  Then docs prescribed them for everything from sexual maladies to snakebite.  For good eyesight too, of course.  And the best ones were grown in Crécy, which famously gave the name to the classic carrot soup of France.  But Crécy-en-Ponthieu, the site of the English victory in 1346, up near Abbeville&#8230;or Crécy-en-Brie, to the east of Paris, in the cheese and sugar-beet district of the Marne?  I wouldn&#8217;t dream of chiming in on this enduring controversy.</p>
<p>
But the fact is, this soup&#8211;evolving from purée to potage to crème&#8211;is eloquent, in its own way, and will definitely (according to my English grandmother) improve your eyesight. Why don&#8217;t you just drop everything and fly to Paris to take in both this humble purée AND the Louvre?</p>
<p>
No? Well, it&#8217;s easy enough to put this soup on your table, wherever you are, and quickly, AND in a pumped up Escoffier version that is fabulous:</p>
<p>
<em>Crème Crécy</em> for 4 people</p>
<p>
2 Tablespoons butter<br />
4 medium carrots, peeled and thinly sliced<br />
1 onion, diced<br />
4 cups chicken stock<br />
1/2 cup rice<br />
1 Tablespoon sugar (the sweetness!)<br />
1 teaspoon salt<br />
1 cup cream<br />
salt and white pepper to taste<br />
2 Tablespoons finely minced parsley<br />
1 Tablespoon butter</p>
<p>
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium low heat and toss in the carrots and onion.  Cover and cook slowly for 15 minutes.  Add the stock, rice, sugar, salt, and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 45 minutes.  Purée in a blender, add the cream and parsley, and return to a simmer.  Season with salt and white pepper to taste.  If you want a thinner soup, add hot water to taste.  Simmer for 5 minutes then swirl in the butter. Ladle into bowls and top with a parsley leaf.</p>
<p>Bon appetit!  And yes, despite what you read in the American press, the French ALWAYS say Bon Appetit before tucking in, and with a great twinkle in their eye, so happy to be eating a fine meal.</p>

<p>
&#8220;Want to go to Brussels this weekend?&#8221;  My friend Stu emailed, posing the question.  You know I did.   
<p>
&#8220;Only if we can see the Atomium,&#8221; I  banter back. &#8220;Deal.&#8221; &#8220;AND that I get to eat Waterzooie, classic Belgian soup.&#8221;  &#8220;Okay, okay!&#8221;
<p>
Four hours and a lot of traffic and and a lot of rain later, first stop: the Atomium.  It was the centerpiece of the 1958 World&#8217;s Fair, and it is still breathtaking and breathtakingly modern, sitting off in its own remote field.
<p>
Now for the waterzooie.  Here&#8217;s what I said about it 10 years ago when I published the <a title="Chicken Waterzooie" href="http://www.soupsong.com/rwaterzo.html">chicken version </a>on soupsong.com: </p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Waterzooie</em> or <em>Waterzootsje</em>&#8211;originating in Flanders&#8211;is one of the great national soups of the world. Belgians are pretty loose with the ingredients, though. Not only does every family have its own recipe that varies eggs, cream, and lemon&#8211;but some use fish instead of chicken. In fact, Escoffier himself captured the recipe as a fish and wine soup. Apparently wine is the ONLY ingredient all these variations have in common&#8211;and even then I have heard of variations that recommend dark Belgian beer instead of wine. This particular recipe, however, is made for the hearts and stomachs of poultry lovers&#8211;it is chicken times a thousand, and wonderfully silky and rich to boot. And just exactly what does <em>Waterzooie</em> mean? I hunted for weeks to find out. It translates to &#8220;a simmering, watery thing.&#8221; In other words, eggs and cream notwithstanding, the broth should not be too thick. Serve hot as a meal to 8 people&#8211;ideally with boiled potatoes, brown bread, and butter on the side.&#8221;
<p>
But as we listened to the blandishments of resto pimps on the crowded rue des Bouchers (street of butchers), we heard &#8220;Free aperitif!&#8221; &#8220;Free waffles!&#8221; &#8220;Special beer!&#8221; &#8220;Waterzooie with lobster!&#8221;</p>
<p>
&#8220;Lobster! Did you hear THAT?&#8221;</p>
<p>
Now we are in a bidding war of restaurants promising this heavenly dish and eventually end up in La Belle Epoch, where we are ushered to a tight little table in an elevated corner overlooking the street&#8217;s wet cobblestones. The waiter stares at us in disbelief.  &#8220;We have no waterzooie with lobster.&#8221;  We assure him that&#8217;s the only reason we&#8217;re sitting in his restaurant.  He huddles with the man out front and comes back, grim-faced.  &#8220;Okay, we have waterzooie with lobster.&#8221; &#8220;How much for it?&#8221; Stu thinks he says 13 euro.</p>
<p>
And here you see it.  Not a soup.  Not 13 euro, but 30&#8211;about $43.  So we don&#8217;t recommend La Belle Epoch by a long stretch.  But for all that, the lobster waterzooie was absolutely delicious.  And we highly recommend the <a title="Chicken Waterzooie" href="http://www.soupsong.com/rwaterzo.html">chicken waterzooie recipe</a> on soupsong.com.  Marvelous!</p>

<p> It&#8217;s November 20 in Paris and the streets are littered with gigantic wine bottle balloons labeled <em>Nouveau Beaujolais 2008</em>.  &#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Dominique, &#8220;let&#8217;s meet at <a href="http://www.restaurant-chartier.com/www/">Bouillon Chartier</a> for lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love this place. It&#8217;s hiding in an alley (see above) not far from the Bourse, has the look and feel of an earlier century or two, serves great food, and today is serving the first sips of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaujolais_nouveau">New Beaujolais</a>.</p>
<p>Our <em>maitre d&#8217;</em> guides us over oceans of empty tables and invites us to squash into a tiny table in a tight corner that&#8217;s already occupied. The attractive couple looks up in surprise. We protest; it&#8217;s no use. <em>Non</em>, no tables for two people only, says the <em>maitre d&#8217;</em>, the place will soon be packed. And of course it is, but in the meantime we have bonded with the couple over the unfairness of life. When my soup arrives (above), the woman asks me what I think of it. Deficient, I say. They laugh and agree. It&#8217;s the only soup on the menu, <em>potage aux legumes</em>, and it&#8217;s thin, ungarnished, and served in a lugged metal bowl that&#8217;s clearly been banged all over the kitchen. The woman gamely lends me her glass of the new wine to add a little class to my photo.  &#8220;My empty glass would tell a better story,&#8221; says the man.</p>
<p>The soup is tasty, though, with the bite of onions, pepper, and a splash of cognac enlivening the dark green lentil puree&#8211;and a great entree to the excellent <em>quenelle de brochet sauce nantua </em>that follows.  The conversation is stimulating and convivial. The atmosphere amusing&#8211;all rosy walls and impossibly high ceilings with elegant moldings; waiters bustling in their traditional &#8220;room clothes&#8221; scribbling the order and adding up the bill on the white table cover; passion for dining and arguing just about evenly divided.   All in all a delicious lunchtime on a festive winter day in Paris.</p>
<p>I highly recommend it:  Le Bouillon Chartier<br />

<p>It was a funny day, me deliberately leaving behind all the heavily &#8220;planned activities at US battlefield cemeteries for Veteran&#8217;s Day&#8221; to strike out into the French countryside.  On such an autumn holiday I thought why not explore the landscapes of the Barbizon school, maybe even climb around the fabled rocks and crags of Fontainebleu forest?   I sure wasn&#8217;t in any hurry to get up or get out; wasn&#8217;t even sure the car would start after all those weeks in Amman.  But there I was in a parking lot behind the town around noon, picking my way over  John Constable Way and up and down the steps of St. Martin Chapel, emerging, to my complete surprise, into the main town square just as the music struck up.  You can see the chapel in the picture, partly blocked by the giant head of Vercingetorix, doomed leader of the Gauls against Caesar&#8217;s legions in 51 BC, who was the centerpiece of the town&#8217;s war memorial, funded in part by American subscription. </p>
<p>Everyone in town showed up.  It was not our Veterans&#8217; Day commemoration; it was specifically the 90th anniversary of Armistice Day, the end of the brutal and devastating trench warfare of WWI that literally destroyed the flower of France.  And those losses were very specific for the families who showed up at the ceremony.  Old fat guys carried the flags and laid the flowers.  The mayor, sashed in red, white, and blue, gave a moving speech.  Eight kids read the poems they&#8217;d written to honor the dead and (always) La Gloire de France, though all the red-faced boys had to be coaxed by the local teacher to read their works of art.  I was completely surprised and moved&#8211;this was no big orchestrated ceremony with political overtones; this was all about people like you and me thinking about family members who went off to war for any number of reasons and laid down their lives for it&#8211;or, with any luck, lived to tell about it.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the upshot?  Everyone left the ceremony and immediately filled up all the restaurants in town to enjoy the day.  Restaurant La Boheme featured one of the great soul foods of France&#8211;pot au feu.  It is exactly the right dish for a cold day in autumn and so soulful in its simplicity and heartiness that I hope you will just bite the bullet and make it from scratch.  Easy enough to do, if you just take it in stages:  <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/zaug05.html">Classic pot au feu</a>.</p>
