Soup or no soup, it was a pleasure to be there and the hunting for the good soup is always exciting&#8230; As from now on, soup is on the menu every night until Spring!  My customers love it.  Last night, I made &#8220;Soupe Verte&#8221; (translate green colored soup with everything green vegies in it)&#8230; For this one, it was made with radish, lettuce and betroot leaves.  It has so much goodness in it and usually those leaves are thrown away!!! Grave erreur!!! So Fry a little onion and then add all the leaves and fry, then add water to cover the leaves (fresh chicken stock if you must and if you have), then a couple of cubed organic potatoes, the waxy type, salt, pepper and grate a little nutmeg then put in the blender and serve with Devonshire clotted cream (I have an organic cream from the market in Bourges at the moment to die for!) if you must!  ET VOILA&#8230;. A little secret, try fried beetroot leaves in butter, garlic and parsley&#8230; Absolutely Yummy!</p>
