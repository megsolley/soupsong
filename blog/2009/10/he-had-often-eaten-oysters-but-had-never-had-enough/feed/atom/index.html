It did not work and they had to go so the oysters stayed and we found the site! Wearing shoes we paddled in the mud no to have the bottom of our feet lacerated by the sharp hedges of the oyster shell  (they were vicious!)and picked up a few for dinner. I remember the huge shells and the size of these oysters was just unreal&#8230;  The New York cut size!  We could not gently slurp them down our throat so we decided to make an oyster chowder.  To tell you the truth, the labelling of Guiness (thick, rich and creamy) really goes for that chowder!  Just heart warming and so so rich! The memories of slurping this soup sitting on the veranda looking at the sun going down the bay of Cygnet was just made of that special moment when you think that life is real good!</p>
