<p>
It was a sunny Sunday afternoon after a winter of cold and misery.  Carmen and I had scheduled a rendezvous, but after my disastrous choice of a pleasant but seedy <em>guinguette</em> for our last meeting, I put her in charge of restaurant reservations.  She chose <a href="http://www.au-chien-qui-fume.com/"><em>Au Chien Qui Fume</em></a>&#8211;which, it turns out, positively bristles with history.  Not to mention extreme nuttiness.  According to its own take on things, this restaurant started out in 1740 as a small inn in the heart of old Paris, right off the Pont Neuf&#8230;but it was blasted away by the Haussman reconstruction and only reappeared in 1920 when a new restaurant was opened by a man who owned a poodle that smoked cigars and a terrier that smoked a pipe.  I don&#8217;t know about you, but I am taking all of this cum grano salis.  <em>Au Chien Qui Fume</em> was the belle of the old Les Halles ball, until that febrile &#8220;belly of Paris&#8221; moved to Rungis in 1971.  Now it remains popular&#8211;yes for its food, but obviously also for the novelty of its dog theme&#8211;and it sits at the corner of a clean and odorless green space in sight of the storied Saint-Eustache gothic church.  It&#8217;s a darling restaurant; it&#8217;s completely ridiculous; and it serves excellent food.</p>
<p>
Ten guesses on my first course.  Soup, of course: la soupe de poisson from Provence.  It was a selection on &#8220;Menu Bazil à 33,70 €&#8221; and it was yummy, served with the traditional crouton, parmesan, and rouille (recipe for rouille on soupsong&#8217;s <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/rcorsazi.html">Aziminu</a>).  Second course <em>La Daurade Royale Grillée au Thym, Tomate, Epinards, Pommes Safranées</em>, a great fish platter&#8211;I was actually shown the whole freshly grilled fish in its wire cage before it was deconstructed into fillets and served with thyme, tomatoes, spinach, and saffroned potatoes.  A glass of white wine, coffee and chocolates, a stroll in and around Saint Eustache to see where Richelieu, Mme. Pompadour, and Moliere had been baptised&#8211;an absolutely delicious day.</p>
<p>
But what about that Soupe de Poisson?  Please note its particular construction: la soupe DE poisson, not la soupe AUX poissons&#8211;intimating it&#8217;s the very essence of fish, not just made of fishes.  Surely it started out with fishermen and their wives making do with the small and broken leftovers of the daily catch&#8211;smooshing them in a pot and straining the flesh and goodness out, leaving the bones and skin behind.  Then, it being France, it got improved over time until at a certain point it became a masterpiece. I love that about France.</p>
<p>
In fact, though, the soup is not that hard to make, as Anthony Bourdain, author of <em>Kitchen Confidential</em> demonstrates:</p>
<p>
6 tablespoons olive oil<br />
4 garlic cloves<br />
2 small onions, thinly sliced<br />
2 leeks, whites only, washed and thinly sliced<br />
1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced<br />
1 can (18 ounces) plum tomatoes, chopped<br />
2 pounds tiny whole fish (such as porgies or whiting), gutted with heads intact, or 4 pounds fish bones and heads<br />
1 Bouquet Garni<br />
zest of 1 orange<br />
3 strands of saffron<br />
1 ounce Pernod<br />
salt and pepper</p>
<p>
Garnishes: <a href="http://www.soupsong.com/rcorsazi.html">Rouille</a>, freshly grated Parmesan, croutons </p>
<p>
Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy pot, add the garlic, onions, leeks, and fennel, cover, and let them sweat for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon.<br />
Add tomatoes and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, then add the small fish or bones. Cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water to cover, as well as the bouquet garni and orange zest. Stir well; add saffron, a dash of salt and pepper, and Pernod. Lower the heat and simmer for about an hour.<br />
Remove pot from heat and let soup cool slightly. Strain the liquid into a large bowl. Crush the remaining solids in the pot, then add them to the strainer and press as much liquid as possible from them. Return all the soup to another pot, reheat, ladle into bowls, and serve with croutons, rouille, and some grated Parmesan on the side. </p>
<p>
Whether you make it yourself or order it out, you&#8217;ll love it.  And I recommend you try it, if your travels bring you this way, at:<br />

(A great hangover cure/preventer.) But can I just say that when I lived in Provence, grated gruyere was always used instead of parmesan.</p>
<p>Also, in the clock/Limousin story, the baguettes in question translate as chopsticks.</p>
<p>Please think of this as a critique, not criticism.</p>

Soup is one of our favorite things to eat &#8230; an entire site dedicated to soup &#8230;  how wonderful!  I have a very heartwarming story about Au Chien Qui Fume. We have a dear friend from Dallas TX who loves Paris and has been there 30+ times over his life of 84 years. We were in Paris this spring, April 2009, with him and he celebrated his 84th birthday while we were there. On each trip to Paris over the past 64 years he has eaten at Au Chien Qui Fume. The first time he was there he was druing WWII and on R&amp;R for a day in Paris. This small group got to Paris late at night and the only place still open was a lovely little bistro on the east bank called Au Chien Qui Fume and the America soldiers were welcomed warmly by the owners and staff. It was a particulay meaningful time since he had just come from the front at the Battle of the Bulge and as an officer had lost many men.  He has made it a point to go back to eat there on every visit since! He still got tears in his eyes as we sat there this spring as he remembered that first cold night in Paris when some warmhearted French people had welcomed some sad and hungry young soliers who needed a few hours to try to forget the horors of war. He says the food and hospitatiy are still as good today as he remembered it being that cold and rainy night 64 years ago. Thanks for your great article that encouraged me to take the time to share this story.  We will now always go back there when we are in Paris and I hope many of you get the opportunity also.</p>
