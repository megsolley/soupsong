		<description>Just happened upon this site ... while looking for information about Au Chien Qui Fume (translated literally, The Dog Who Smokes) ....and love the information about soup!  Soup is one of our favorite things to eat ... an entire site dedicated to soup ...  how wonderful!  I have a very heartwarming story about Au Chien Qui Fume. We have a dear friend from Dallas TX who loves Paris and has been there 30+ times over his life of 84 years. We were in Paris this spring, April 2009, with him and he celebrated his 84th birthday while we were there. On each trip to Paris over the past 64 years he has eaten at Au Chien Qui Fume. The first time he was there he was druing WWII and on R&#38;R for a day in Paris. This small group got to Paris late at night and the only place still open was a lovely little bistro on the east bank called Au Chien Qui Fume and the America soldiers were welcomed warmly by the owners and staff. It was a particulay meaningful time since he had just come from the front at the Battle of the Bulge and as an officer had lost many men.  He has made it a point to go back to eat there on every visit since! He still got tears in his eyes as we sat there this spring as he remembered that first cold night in Paris when some warmhearted French people had welcomed some sad and hungry young soliers who needed a few hours to try to forget the horors of war. He says the food and hospitatiy are still as good today as he remembered it being that cold and rainy night 64 years ago. Thanks for your great article that encouraged me to take the time to share this story.  We will now always go back there when we are in Paris and I hope many of you get the opportunity also.</description>

		<description>Love the stories you've published here and I know Au Chien qui Fume quite well, although when we were in Paris we always ate our soupe de poisson at Au Pied de Cochon in the early hours of the morning. (A great hangover cure/preventer.) But can I just say that when I lived in Provence, grated gruyere was always used instead of parmesan.

Also, in the clock/Limousin story, the baguettes in question translate as chopsticks.

Please think of this as a critique, not criticism.</description>
