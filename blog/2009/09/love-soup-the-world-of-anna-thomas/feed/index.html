		<description><![CDATA[I am thrilled and delighted to find this site (pointed out to me by my publisher).  All soup all the time!  You are my people.  I&#039;m going into the archive, will read every post.  And thank you for the insightful and enthusiastic review.  Let&#039;s make it a better world, one great pot of soup at a time.  -- Cheers from Anna Thomas]]></description>
