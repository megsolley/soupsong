In this saga of Australia's beginnings, Bryce Courtenay tells the story of Ikey Solomon, an English criminal in the first half of the 19th century, who makes the harsh journey from London to the convict settlement of Van Dieman's Land in Australia.
<P>
It is when Ikey flees London and temporarily lands in New York City that he and the author reflect on their assumptions of what it means to be Jewish--including the birthright of chicken soup:
<BLOCKQUOTE><H5>As an English Jew Ikey had assumed that he would fit in snugly enough.  After all, the Jews of his world were street traders and merchants and of a naturally talkative and friendly disposition with the inclination to congregate together, marry among themselves, and on those several pious occasions such as Passover, Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kuppur to share their faith.  They would also attend synogogue on the Sabbath as brothers according to the ancient laws of Abraham, the prophets and the rabbinical creed.
<P>
Being a Jew, while being a matter of religion and orthodoxy, was also one of temperament.  A Jew does not expect any but his own kind to understand him.  Being Jewish is not something you wear outwardly like a badge, rather it is something you feel inwardly.  It is as if your heart beats to a different cadence.  This is as true of the Jew who is a villain as it is of one who is a rabbi.  The smell of a chicken soup fart with noodles is absolutely one hundred per cent unmistakably Jewish.  If you should be making chicken soup, delicious chicken soup, and you wish to make it Jewish, maybe you could try making these noodles.
<P>
<I>Beat two eggs with a little bit of pepper and salt.  Add flour until it is a stiff paste.  Flour a cutting board, then roll out the paste until it is very thin.  Allow to dry for two hours.  Now cut the dough into strips about three inches long by one inch wide.  Stack and cut again into matchlike strips.  Separate them by tossing, and spread them out to dry.  Then toss them with boiling chicken soup and boil for ten minutes.  Guaranteed to produce first-class farts when added to chicken soup!</I></H5></BLOCKQUOTE>
