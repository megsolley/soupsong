<LI>1 <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, chopped into bite-sized chunks
<LI>1/4 pound dark-gilled <A HREF="fmushroo.html">mushrooms</A>, quartered

<LI>3 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#fish stock">fish stock</A>
<LI>1 15-oz. can of <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A>, seeded and chopped
<LI>1<A HREF="fsquash.html"> zucchini</A>, cut into eighths and cut into bite-sized chunks
<LI><A HREF="fbay.html">bay leaf</A>
<LI>1/4 teaspoon <A HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A>, crushed to a powder
<LI>1/4 teaspoon <A HREF="foregano.html">oregano</A>, crushed to a powder
<LI>pinch <A HREF="fpepper.html">hot pepper flakes</A>
<LI>1 pint standard <A HREF="foyster.html">oysters</A>
<LI><A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>
</UL>

In a large saucepan, saute the onions and mushrooms over a high heat, until the onions are golden and the mushrooms are brown.  Add garlic and stir for a minute.  Add fish stock, chopped tomatoes and the juice reserved from the can of tomatoes.  Stir in the bay leaf, rosemary, oregano, and hot peppers.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, for 25 minutes. 
<P>
Add the zucchini chunks, cover, and simmer another 10 minutes, until the zucchini is almost tender.  Then slip the oysters with their liquid into the soup and cook, uncovered, just until their edges begin to curl.  You want them tender, not chewy. 
<P>
Ladle immediately into bowls.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.  Fat, dense oyster biscuits taste awfully good with this soup.
