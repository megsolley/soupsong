<HR>
<H5>This excellent "chicken soup" is especially nice for invalids and babies, with its soft, digestible rice--a barely coddled, protein-rich egg--tender, ground pork bits--and appetite-stimulating spices. (The chilis really pack a wallop, so be careful!) The soup is also traditional for breakfast.  Serve this hot to 2 people to coax their appetites--or double the recipe for a savory breakfast or lunch for 4 people.</H5>
<HR>

<H5><UL>
<LI>2 cups light <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1/4 cup <A HREF="fmeat.html">ground pork</A>
<LI>1/2 cup cooked <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="ffish.html"><I>nam pla</I></A> or other fish sauce
<LI>2 small <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">eggs</A>
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I> 2 teaspoons finely minced fresh <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger root</A>; 2 teaspoons minced <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro</A>; 1 minced <A HREF="fgronion.html">green onion</A>; 1 teaspoon golden friend onion flakes (which you can make by tossing dried onion flakes in an oil slicked frying pan); and 1/8-1/2 teaspoon dried red chilis, minced
<P>
In a saucepan, bring the stock to a boil and add the ground pork, stirring to break it up.  Reduce heat to a simmer, stir in the cooked rice, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Season with the fish sauce.
<P>
When ready to serve, break a whole egg into each individual bowl.  Bring the soup to a boil and ladle over the egg yolks.  Garnish with ginger, cilantro, green onions, onion flakes, and as much chili as you think you can handle. Cover the bowls with lids, let sit for a minute to let the egg poach, then serve to your sick chicks.</H5>
