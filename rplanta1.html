<H5>Simple but exotic--deceptively substantial as a first course.  Many thanks to Mima Stickney, Puerto Rican by birth, who has contributed garlic and cilantro to the recipe--making the soup more authentic and also, in her words, "deliciosa and extremely  nourishing! Great served with garlic bread dipped in olive oil." Serve hot to 6 people, follow with grilled meat and juicy tropical fruits.</H5>

<P>
Peel the plantains and cut into 1/2-inch slices.  Soak them in cold, salted water for 20 minutes.  Drain and pat dry. In a heavy frying pan, saute the plantains and garlic in lard until they are tender, about 15 minutes.  The pieces will be gold colored and will brown a little.  Drain well on paper towels, then crush with a pestle or mallet until they break into bits.
<P>
Heat the beef stock in a large saucepan and add the plantain.  Simmer for 15 minutes, adjust seasoning and stir in the cilantro, then ladle into bowls.  Garnish with generous handfuls of grated parmesan.
