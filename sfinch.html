<BLOCKQUOTE>
Methinks this World is oddly made,<BR>
And ev'ry thing's amiss,<BR>
A dull presuming Atheist said,<BR>
As stretch'd he lay beneath a Shade;<BR>
And instanced in this:
<P>
Behold, quoth he, that mighty thing,<BR>
A <I>Pumpkin</I>, large and round,<BR>
Is held but by a little String,<BR>
Which upwards cannot make it spring,<BR>
Or bear it from the Ground.
<P>
Whilst on this <I>Oak</I>, a Fruit so small,<BR>
So disproportion'd, grows;<BR>
That, who with Sence surveys this <I>All</I>,<BR>
This universal Casual Ball,<BR>
Its ill contrivance knows.
<P>
My better Judgment wou'd have hung<BR>
That Weight upon a Tree,<BR>
And left this Mast, thus slightly strung,<BR>
'Mongst things which on the Surface sprung,<BR>
And small and feeble be.
<P>
No more the Caviller cou'd say,<BR>
Nor farther Faults descry;<BR>
For, as he upwards gazing lay,<BR>
An <I>Acorn</I>, loosen'd from the Stay,<BR>
Fell down upon his Eye.
<P>
Th'offended Part with Tears ran o'er,<BR>
As punish'd for the Sin:<BR>
Fool! had that Bough a <I>Pumpkin</I> bore,<BR>
Thy Whimseys must have work'd no more,<BR>
Nor Scull had kept them in.

<P>

<H5>NOTE:  In the poem, "casual" means "created by chance"; "mast" means "acorn"; and "stay" refers to the bough on which the acorn grows.</H5>
