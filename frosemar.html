By long tradition the "herb of remembrance" (see Ophelia's mad scene in <I>Hamlet</I>), its gilded branches were once carried at weddings--and it was customary to lay rosemary on the coffin at a funeral.  
<P>
It also was regarded as a preventive to plague.  Thus, when the plague swept through England in 1603, carrying with it over 1100 people each week in London alone, the price of rosemary skyrocketed--from 12 pence for an armful of it...to 72 pence for a tiny bunch.
<P>
It's one of the strongest flavored herbs--as anyone knows who grows it.  We had shoulder-high hedges of it around our villa in Casablanca--and after a spirited match of croquet on the lawn, we'd all have to go to the beach to air out for a couple hours.  Use as a flavoring in moderation.
