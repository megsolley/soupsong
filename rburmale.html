<HR>
<H5>This "sweet" Burmese soup is ferociously filling, thanks to all the substantial, deep fried garnishes. Really yummy, with so much heat and crunch and flavor accenting the bland dal foundation.  Serve barely warm to 4 as a meal.</H5>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="flentil.html">red lentils </A>
<LI>6 cups water 
<LI>1/4 cup <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro</A>, chopped 
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A> to taste 
</UL>
 <P>
<I>Garnishes: </I>
<UL>
<LI>2 <A HREF="fpepper.html">hot green chile peppers</A>, cut into rings and soaked in <A HREF="bflavor.html">white vinegar</A> to cover for at least an hour. 
<LI>2 cups chopped sweet <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>, cooked slowly in 1/3 cup <A HREF="bflavor.html">peanut oil</A> until dark and carmelized. 
<LI>2 <A HREF="fpotato.html">potatoes</A>, peeled and grated and cooked in an inch of hot <A HREF="bflavor.html">oil</A> until crisp and golden brown, then drained on paper towels. 
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="bthicken.html">bread cubes</A>, cooked in an inch of hot <A HREF="bflavor.html">oil</A> and <A HREF="bflavor.html">butter</A> until golden crisp--watch carefully, this goes fast. 
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro</A>, chopped. 
</UL>
 <P>
Wash the lentils thoroughly, then pour into a large pot with 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook partially covered until the lentils lose their shape and make a thick porridge. Stir in the chopped cilantro, season to taste, and set aside. 
 <P>
While the lentils are cooking, begin preparing the garnishes, in the order given. As they're done, place in small bowls to pass with the soup. When ready to serve, pour the soup (barely warm) into a tureen and take it and the garnish bowls to the table. Invite your guests to put 2-3 ladles full of soup into their soup bowls and heap the garnishes in a pile in the middle of the bowl.
