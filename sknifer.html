<BR>
In my erratic peregrinations about forever evening-darkened September fields
I came across people with knives, too.
The one who approached my campfire in the dusk did not have a knife on him. 
<P>

"Baking taters, are you?" he asked settling himself down some distance away 
from the fire.
<P>
"And cooking fish soup, we are," I supplied in the plural, even though I
was alone, not a companion in sight, for two hundred miles around.
<P>
"So I'm saying - fish-catchers. It's the kind of smoke to your fire -
fish-catching. I said to myself, soon as I saw it from afar: Them is
fish-catchers... And where's your mate now?" For some reason I did not feel like
telling him the truth.
<P>
"Me mate? He's over there," I jerked my chin in the direction of the river. 
Some sounds were indeed drifting toward us from that side: women's voices,
or was it gull shrieks? It was perfectly feasible that over there, among those
voices, some mate of mine also found room for himself.
<P>
"And what's he doing, your mate? Fishing?"
<P>
"Well, no," I replied trying hard to figure out what kind of mate I might
have yonder amid the distant sounds, in an effort to visualize him. "Me mate,
now, he's... you know... looking for his knife."
<P>
"Is he really? Lost 'un, then?"
<P>
I don't know where I got that "mate" from and why I said that he was looking
for a knife. Utter hogwash that had suddenly occurred to me. I had to give some 
answer, though, and the simplest answer would be to say that "my mate" had lost 
his knife. Oddly enough, I did not want "my mate" to lose one.
<P>
"No, no, he hasn't lost his knife," I said, waving off the smoke, and ladled
out a potato from the pot. "That knife..."
<P>
I broke off, because I didn't have a clue what he might possibly be doing
with that knife, this "mate" of mine. Could he be sitting on the bank whetting
it on a boulder or something?
<P>
"... to him is like a new toy to a kid, something special, you know," I
finished the sentence somewhat vaguely and grumpily. I was sort of annoyed with 
"my mate" who had got under my skin with his silly fads, and especially with his
knife.
<P>
The man who had come up to my campfire read some meaning of his own into my 
words and edged a little closer. I did not like that. A trifle too intrusive for
the late hour. My dusk visitor, thin as a shadow, did not excite any confidence 
or friendly feeling, to say the least. What did he want, roaming about other
people's campfires?
<P>
"Yours ain't a bad knife neither," he said nodding at my bowie knife covered
in silver bream scales that was lying by the fire.
<P>
"That's nothing, just a bowie," I said dismissively, to imply that my mate's
knife was in a different class. Only what could he have done with it? Why was he
looking for the blasted thing?
Perhaps he had been throwing it? What at? A tree? What for? Was he a perfect
nitwit? Could be.
<P>
But no, I did not want my mate to be the kind of nitwit who would throw
knives at trees. Probably he threw his knife at a big fish that had surfaced? At
a chub? And the knife was attached to a piece of string?
That's better. At least it was pretty unorthodox, to have a mate who threw
knives at big fish as they surfaced. I quite liked the sort.
<P>
"A bowie knife... I used to have one too..." said my dusk visitor picking up
my knife and testing its blade against the pad of his thumb. "Nice an'
sharp..." "Put it back."
<P>
"I ain't doing no harm. Can't a guy touch your knife?"
<P>
"No. It belongs ... to my mate."
<P>
My mythical mate seemed to be positively cluttered with knives. One he threw
at chub, another was lying by the fire.
<P>
"He's got two knives, then?"
<P>
"More," I said. "I haven't counted them. Do you have one?"
<P>
"They took it away," he waved his arm forlornly.
<P>
"Took it away?"
<P>
"When they nabbed me they took it away, and I ain't had the time to get me a
new one..."
<P>
Oh, super. He'd been nabbed, had he? I knew there had been something like
that.
<P>
My dusk visitor was silently staring at the fire; he seemed lost in reverie 
about the happy times when they had not yet taken his knife away. What had he
been doing with that knife, I wondered? Nothing very jolly, it seemed. I was
enjoying the knife conversation less and less.
<P>
"What's he want with so many knives, your mate?"
<P>
"Andy, you mean?" I asked to make quite sure.
<P>
I felt that it was about time "my mate" was given a name. And the name
emerged effortlessly - Andy. A big redhead, huge even, slightly on the bald
side. He had thrown his knife at a chub and missed.
<P>
And the knife, though attached to a string, had sunk in the river, so now
Andy was diving in the midstream looking for the knife. I had a clear mental
picture of huge Andy diving in the middle of the slow river groping all over the
bottom.
<P>
"So what's he do with them knives? Pickle them or what?" the dusk visitor
sniggered for some reason.
<P>
"He throws them," I said concisely. And added by way of explanation: "At
chub."
<P>
The man whose knife had been taken away fell silent musing over the method
Andy might employ to throw his knife at chub. The cogitation process was
hard-going, and I added to help his efforts:
<P>
"He's that sort, you know... a knifer."
<P>
The word hadn't clarified the matter much, and I took a few steps away from 
the fire and hollered toward the river:
"Andy-y-y... Andy-y-y!"
<P>
There was no reply. The voices of women or gulls had long since ceased.
<P>
"I hope he hasn't drowned," I muttered.
<P>
"He won't, never fear," the knifeless man reassured me. "He'll be here
directly."
<P>
"He'd better," I grumbled. "The fish soup is done... Okay, let it cool for
a while."
<P>
I took the pot off the fire and put it on the ground. The soup steam did
not mix with the campfire smoke, it rose over the pot in a separate foamy
column. The dusk visitor did not move closer to the soup; he was settled
firmly, apparently waiting for Andy.
<P>
"Right," I said, "it's cooling off... let's spoon up the pottage, shall we, 
while he's not here. We'll leave some for him." I offered a spoon to my dusk
visitor.
<P>
"Go on, taste it."
<P>
"You wait for your mate, buddy," he said. Then he got up and strode away
from the fire in the direction of the village.
<P>
"Hey, hold on a second. Come and taste the fish soup, there's enough for
three here..."
<P>
"Nah, it's okay," he waved his hand without turning back. "I don't want any 
fish soup. "
<P>
Night was setting in fast, and his gaunt form was vanishing as it receded
into the field. Soon I could not make him out at all.
I took a sip of the soup, added some salt and a pinch of pepper. Then I
walked a few paces from the fire and again yelled toward the river:
<P>
"Andy-y-y... Andy-y-y-y!"
<P>
It had grown quite dark when I heard a distant shout:<BR>
"Comi-i-ing..."
