<H5>It was Jackie Mason who said "You know how movies always have sex scenes and the studios say that is because sex is part of life and movies should be lifelike?  So why don't movies have more soup scenes? Soup is part of life; no one was ever too tired to have soup." <BR> Well guess what?  Soup is everywhere in the movies, from Spartacus igniting the slave rebellion by drowning the Centurion master in a pot of bean soup...to Inspector Oxford, in Hitchcock's <I>Frenzy</I>, actively dismayed by his wife's soupe de poisson. ...Ya gotta know NOW:  What the heck is Our Man Flint doing in Marseilles ordering up all that Bouillabaise?

We first see her poor ailing father in bed, fed impatiently by his unsympathetic wife:  "Why Virgil, you're not eating your soup.  Don't want to? Oh but you must eat it.  You must to get your strength back.  You've got to get good and strong so you can smile all around and get around again." Then we see Alice trying to impress Arthur (Fred McMurray) with a formal dinner prepared by hired maid Malena (Hattie McDaniels) on a VERY hot night.  It's a disaster, just as Hattie predicted.  "What a lack of imagination to prepare anything so hot on a night like this.  Please take this dreadful soup away," Kate expostulates.  Thanks to Bev McMullen for the cite.

HA:  That's okay, I've got an acid stomach.  That Cajun cooking kills me.<BR>
EK:  Pity about your stomach; you'd have enjoyed our gumbo.<BR>

       <TD>It was 1962.  Delta Tao Chi House of Faber College had selected its pledges.  Dean Wormer (John Vernon) was not happy with Delta activities--and placed it on the dreaded double-secret probation.  That was just about the time that Flounder (Steve Furst) ran afoul of Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), his commanding officer at ROTC, for wearing his Delta pledge pin on his uniform.  Enter Boon (Peter Riegert) and Otter (Tim Matheson), who retaliated by hitting golf balls at Neidermeyer.  Oops.  What a hook:  lands right in the soup kettle in the school cafeteria kitchen. ...Much later, we find John 'Bluto' Blutarksy (John Belushi) cruising the garbage trays in that same cafeteria.  Hey, there's a bowl of soup (watery beef onion?) with a golf ball in it.  Mmmmmmmm.  He picks out the golf ball and eats it in 3 bites.

That doesn't prevent them from mothering the rest of Brooklyn:<BR>
Abby:  How's Missus Brophy?<BR>
Officer Brophy:  Oh she's better, thank you, but, uh, a little weak still.<BR>
Abby:  Oh, well I'll go and get a little <A HREF="rbeeftea.html">beef broth</A> for you to take to her.<BR>

       <TD>Turtle soup kicks off the greatest meal these simple Jutlanders ever dreamed of eating.  The movie opens with Martina and Filippa, Danish puritan sisters, taking the poor and sick villagers bowls of good soup.  Only later do we find out why that soup is so good:  it's been prepared by one of the great chefs of the world, transplanted to Jutland after a brutal French uprising in 1871.  When this chef unexpectedly wins the lottery, years later, she spends every sou creating a 5-star meal in honor of Martina and Filippa's deceased pastor father, including this turtle soup.  Happily, a famous Danish general is present at the meal who has the discrimination to say:

       <TD> In the Disney Animated Film <I>Beauty and the Beast,</I> in the scene where they are both eating lunch together, the Beast had a hard time drinking the soup with a spoon until Belle shows him to drink it directly from the plate and so they do together. (Thanks to John Beauchamp of Miami, Florida, for the contribution!)<BR>Another opinion from Katie in Manchester, UK:  "I would just like to point out that in Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" the soup you refer to is in fact porridge.  You will notice its lumpy consistency and the fact that they add sugar and mile to it to make it easy to drink."  And, of course, she's right.  Never mind that porridge has evolved from the soup category in modern times.

       <TD>This odd musical/gangster movie is played by an all-kid cast, including a young Jodie Foster who has the hots for Bugsy (Scott Baio). When a
gangland war begins, fought with cream pies against a higher tech machine gun that shoots marshmallows, Bugsy goes to a soup kitchen to enlist homeless
guys in the fight.  It's all heart, seeing soup being ladled into bowls and guys sitting at a table slurping it while Bugsy (lip-syncing a song) tries to convince them to help him
smash Dandy Dan.  This classic is a fave of Steve McMullen, who saw it in the theater with his girlfriend, soon to become his wife.

       <TD>In this shattered memoir of 1936 Spain on the brink of civil war, soup operates as a symbol of family tranquillity:  first, boiling over on the stove when Moncho (Manuel Lozano) argues with his mother (Uxia Blanco) over the existence of God and the devil; second, served from a tureen as a sacrament of family life--the traditional Galician soup with pork and lots of cabbage; and third, offered to Don Gregorio (Fernando Fern&#225;n G&#243;mez) as a restorative after he wades into a river with Moncho to save him from a dangerous asthma attack.

"Sukebind" is the correct reference, apparently a neologism made up by CCFarm author Stella Gibbons from "honeysuckle" and "bindweed" to signify a weed whose annual blossoming portends fertility, passion, and fruitfulness.</B><P>This one is pretty obscure, but attested to by some of the  most rigorous contributors to Soup Goes to the Movies, Bev and Steve McMullen:  "When Flora's (Kate Beckinsale's) cousin Elfine (Maria Miles) announces her marriage
to a rich local young man, (which Flora helped engineer), the farmhand
shouts that she was promised to him.  He is dissuaded and he grabs the maids
assistant (who he has fathered three children by) and throws her over his
shoulder and heads out the door.  The cook says "... there will
be another one when the soup vine blooms."  A minute later there is a shot
of a blooming vine on a fence. We are sure she said soup vine.  We listened to it three times, but dialects are in play here."

<H6>Narrator: He was the guerilla terrorist for the food service industry. Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque, he farted on the meringue, sneezed on braised endive, and as for the cream of mushroom soup, well...<BR>
Tyler Durden: Tell 'em.<BR>

       <TD>A story of the British soldier, from the Boer War through World World I and into the years of World War II.  Clive Candy (Roger Livesy) has fought or tried to fight in all of them, with the gallant old ideals of earlier times--and in flashbacks he meets up throughout with his Prussian friend Theo (Anton Walbrook) and 3 women, all played by Deborah Kerr.  Clive, his female driver "Johnny," and Theo are all served soup for dinner...which they fail to eat.  It is ultimately removed by Clive's batman (John Laurie).<P>

       <TD>This homage to the transmutation of love through food opens with the birth of the extraordinary cook Tita:  "fed by Nacha, Tita grew up in the kitchen amid the smells of the kitchen, chicken soup, thyme, laurel, steamed milk, garlic, and, of course, onion."  And it is soup--Chencha's bowl of magic beef broth--that restores Tita to life after she suffers from a nervous breakdown.  As she comes back from the brink of madness and speaks, Chencha says, "Broths can cure any type of illness, be it physical or mental."

and even the TV newscasts are restricted to only happy news.) But then each
couple is enjoying some soup when one discovers a fly in the soup. Sharp
words escalate into furious ANGER which leads to violent fighting and
torrents of soup flowing down the stairs of the apartment house, which ultimately burns
to the ground. Rioting breaks out in the street, quickly escalating to
international tensions, the outbreak of war, an exchange of nuclear-tipped
missiles, and the ultimate destruction of planet Earth. The closing title
expresses the hope that the other six deadly sins won't be as destructive."

       <TD>Four soups served in 4 key scenes--all from beautiful tureens at Jewish family dinners in Budapest, largely before the fall of Emperor Franz Josef's multicultural liberal stable regime.  In the happy days, papa Emmanuel Sonnenschein (David De Keyser) complains, "There's too much salt in this soup!"  To which Valeria (Jennifer Ehle) replies, "The cook must be in love."  That's before her love for brother/cousin Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered.  Next:  Valeria is preggers and Ignatz announces his intention to marry her, right before the soup is served.  Mama (Miriam Margolyes) faints, falls on the floor, and "Sunshine," the famous family herbal tonic, is administered.  Third:  Wedding soup, with dumplings.  And last, Ignatz--ignominious after the death of Franz Josef and the rise of the communists, under arrest and a shadow of himself--is served soup in the same bowl, from the same tureen, as had been his papa.  "There is no salt in this soup," he weeps.  And mama and estranged wife fight over the salt shaker, a contest that hinges on whether his taste or his blood pressure will be served. The dinners, the bowls, the tureens, the religion--all are swept away henceforth.

       <TD>The honeymoon is over; paranoia sets in; it's an intimate dinner in Devon with new acquaintances; and poet Sylvia Plath (Gwyneth Paltrow) imagines that husband Ted Hughes (David Craig), a more recognized poet at that time, is beginning to fancy Assia Wevill (Amira Casar)...or is she imagining it?  "The soup is extraordinary," says Assia, and Ted insists on ladling out more into her flat soup plate.  With a come hither look she says, "I always did like my food."  And it was downhill from there.

        <TD><B>La Symphonie Pastoral (1946)</B><BR>Dir., Jean Delannoy</TD>
       <TD>A superb contribution, sent in by pal Ray Connolly in these words:  "The story deals with a pastor in the Swiss Alps summoned to a dilapidated cabin where an old woman has died. He learns that she has a blind daughter who is running wild in animal-like conditions (&#224; la Truffaut's WILD CHILD). He and a neighbor woman make a pot of soup (type not identified) and the pastor takes a dish of it to an open doorway and starts hitting the dish with a spoon. ("Soup, soup, wonderful soup!" No, that was my imagination.) Yes, sure enough, this wild girl comes a-runnin from the woods and gets down on her knees to slurp up the soup like a dog or cat would. The slurping sounds are real loud. You'll love this scene!"  Many thanks, Raymundo!
