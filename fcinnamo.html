<HR>

Cinnamon is surely the exotic spice of the ages.  Used since biblical times as a perfume and as incense, it was originally imported into Egypt and Judea by the Phoenicians.  
<P>
Native to Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and India, it is actually the inner bark of a tropical evergreen tree that can grow to a height of 35 feet. After the bark is peeled from the tree, it is left to dry and ferment for a day, then the outer bark is scraped away.  As the inner bark dries, it curls into its characteristic single quill.  Ceylon (or true) cinnamon is tan colored with a mildly sweet flavor.
<P>
Cassia (Cinnamomum cassia)--a close relative native to Malaysia and Indonesia has FDA approval to be sold in the United States as cinnamon.  It is dark, reddish-brown and has a stronger, slightly bittersweet flavor. When its inner bark dries, it curls from both ends, into scrolls.
<P>
Both true cinnamon and cassia have powerfully antiseptic essential oils (think about toothpaste) help to preserve food.
