FALSTAFF:   Well, I'll
        be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
        go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two
        stones to me: if the young <A HREF="ffish.html">dace</A> be a bait for the
        old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
        may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
CLOWN:    I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
        I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
        of sugar, five pound of <A HREF="bflavor.html">currants</A>, <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>,--what will
        this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
        hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
        on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
        the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
        ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
        one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
        horn-pipes. I must have <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> to colour the warden
        pies; <A HREF="fmace.html">mace</A>; <A HREF="bflavor.html">dates</A>?--none, that's out of my note;
        <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmegs</A>, seven; a race or two of <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>, but that I
        may beg; four pound of <A HREF="bflavor.html">prunes</A>, and as many of
        <A HREF="bflavor.html">raisins</A> o' the sun.

<U>Romeo and Juliet, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
NURSE:   They call for <A HREF="bflavor.html">dates</A> and <A HREF="fquince.html">quinces</A> in the pastry.

<U>Henry IV, part I, II, 2</U>:  <BR>
FALSTAFF:      Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
        before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
        arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
        no more valour in that Poins than in a <A HREF="fmeat.html">wild-duck</A>
<P>
FALSTAFF:       If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
        gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
        I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
        soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
        none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
        me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
        twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
        as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
        fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
        fowl or a hurt <A HREF="fmeat.html">wild-duck</A> (IV, 2).

<U>Pericles, Prince of Tyre, III, Prologue</U>:<BR>
GOWER (explaining the action):  His queen with child makes her desire--
        Which who shall cross?--along to go:
        Omit we all their dole and woe:
        Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
        And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
        On Neptune's billow; half the flood
        Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
        Varies again; the grisly north
        Disgorges such a tempest forth,
        That, as a <A HREF="fmeat.html">duck</A> for life that dives,
        So up and down the poor ship drives.
<P>
<U>The Tempest, II, 2)</U>:<BR>
TRINCULO:      Swum ashore. man, like a <A HREF="fmeat.html">duck</A>: I can swim like a
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">duck</A>, I'll be sworn.

STEPHANO        Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">duck</A>, thou art made like a goose.
