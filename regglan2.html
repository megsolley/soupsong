<HR>
<H5>This soup version of the classic Provencal dish is good hot or cold, pureed or not, as a first course or a meal.  Talk about a soup for all seasons.  And even the fussiest eaters like it pureed...so long as you don't tell them that eggplant is in it.  Serve to 4-6 people, depending on whether it's to be a meal or a hearty first course.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>1 large <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, chopped
<LI>1 teaspoon <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, chopped
<LI>1 medium <A HREF="fsquash.html">zucchini</A>, chopped
<LI>1 small <A HREF="feggplan.html">eggplant</A>, chopped (about a cup)
<LI>1 <A HREF="fpepper.html">yellow bell pepper</A>, chopped (you can also substitute green or red)
<LI>2 pounds fresh or canned <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A>, peeled and chopped
<LI>2 Tablespoons fresh<A HREF="fbasil.html"> basil</A>, sliced fine
<LI>1 teaspoon fresh <A HREF="fthyme.html">thyme</A> minced (or 1/4 teaspoon dried)
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable</A> or <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>pinch <A HREF="fpepper.html">cayenne pepper</A>
<LI>1 teaspoon <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> (ideally, sea salt, that great <I>sel de mer</I> from France)
<LI>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A>
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  <A HREF="bflavor.html#vinegar">balsamico vinegar</A> and shreds of fresh <A HREF="fbasil.html">basil</A>
<P>
In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, saute the onion and garlic in the oil for about 3 minutes over medium heat, then toss in the eggplant, zucchini, and pepper and saute, stirring from time to time, another 5 minutes.
<P>
Cut in the tomatoes with their juice and stir.  Stir in the basil, thyme, stock, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes.
<P>
If you are going to serve the soup hot and chunky, ladle it into bowls immediately.  Spoon a little balsamic vinegar over each serving and sprinkle with fresh basil.
<P>
If you'd like to serve it as a puree, ladle the solids into the blender first, then thin with the broth.  You can serve it hot immediately--or chill and serve it cold.  In all cases, garnish each bowl at serving time with a dribble of balsamico and fresh basil shreds.
<P>
The soup is also good as a chunky cold soup--it's nicely substantial for a refreshing summer lunch.
