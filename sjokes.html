<LI>Two missionaries were captured by a tribe of cannibals who put them in a large pot of boiling water. After a few minutes, one of the missionaries started to laugh uncontrollably. "What's so funny?" said the other.

At a particular convent, the nuns lived under a vow of silence that could be broken only once a year.  One year, at the appointed time, the clock struck 12 noon as the nuns were eating lunch and one spoke up and said, "This soup is terrible."  A year passed, and at the appointed time, another sister volunteered, "I don't think it's so bad."  The following year, as the clock struck 12 noon, a third nun spoke up:  "Bicker, bicker, bicker!" she said.
<P>
<LI>I was eating soup at a restaurant the other night when I dropped my spoon. A waiter walking past at that moment immediately produced one from his pocket and placed it before me. "Do you always carry a soup spoon in your pocket?" I asked. "Well sir," he said, "We had an efficiency expert give a lecture here last week and he told us that 30 percent of all diners who order soup drop their spoons. So rather than make such frequent trips back to the silverware station he advised us to all carry soup spoons to save time." I had to agree it made sense in an odd sort of way. During dessert I noticed the same waiter walk by, and there was a string dangling from his fly. I motioned him over and discreetly pointed it out. "Thank you sir." he said. "This is part of the efficiency program as well. You see, the other end of the string is attached to my, um, privates. When we male waiters need to pee, we just unzip our fly, use the loose end of the string to pull ourselves out, and pee without ever touching anything. Therefore we don't have to wash our hands and it saves about a minute each time." I thought about this for a moment then asked him, "But how do you get yourself back in your pants?" "I don't know what the other waiters do sir, but I use the soup spoon." (Many thanks for the contribution from Tom Notes from Highland Lakes, New Jersey)

<LI>A minister was at a banquet when a careless waiter dropped a steaming bowl of soup into his lap.  The minister looked around the room with agony in his face and finally whispered, "Would some layman kindly say something appropriate?" (Milton Berle)

<LI>The fabulously wealthy banker Baron von Rothschild was traveling through the countryside and stopped for breakfast at a little deli.  The soup was absolutely delicious.  When he finished, the waiter brought him the bill.  Rothschild was stunned:  $100 for a bowl of chicken soup, he exclaimed.  That's impossible.  Is chicken soup so rare in these parts?  No, replied the waiter, but Rothschilds are.

<LI>To soup--may it be seen and not heard.

<LI>"Waiter, come here and taste this soup."  "Where's the spoon?"  "Gotcha!"
<P>
<LI>A middle-aged man was sitting in a truck stop when three mean-looking bikers walked in.  The first walked over to the man and stubbed a cigarette out in his soup.  Then the second biker spat in the soup.  Finally the third biker picked up the bowl of soup and threw it on the floor.  Without saying a word, the man got up and left.  "He wasn't much of a man, was he?" sneered one of the bikers to the waitress.  "Not much of a truck driver, either," she said.  "He just backed his truck over 3 motorcycles."
<P>
<LI>A guy sat down in a restaurant and ordered a bowl of bean soup.  "I'm sorry," the waitress said, "but the customer next to you had the last bowl."  The guy could see that the other customer had left most of the soup.  "Could I have that?" he asked.  "Sure."  So he started eating--but halfway down he discovered a dead mouse.  "Ugh," he said, "I just found a dead mouse in the soup."  "That's as far as I got too," said the other man."
<P>
<LI>"Good manners:  the noise you don't make when you're eating soup."  (Bennett Cerf)
<P>
<LI>There once was an ambitious young waiter who left the Regents Palace Hotel in London to join the staff of Claridge's.  On his second night in the dining room, as he was serving soup to Lord and Lady Thingamy at table 14, he noticed that one of her ladyship's breasts had fallen out of her decolletage and was, as they say, hanging loose.  With perfect aplomb, he replaced it in her bodice with a soup spoon and returned to his station, where he was met by a glowering maitre d'.  "That may be how they do things at the Regents Palace Hotel, Higgins," he snapped furiously, "but in Claridge's, we would always use a warm spoon."
<P>
<LI>Old Perceval decided to treat himself for his 100th birthday.  So he flew first-class to San Francisco and checked into the Fairmont Hotel.  The mischievous hotel concierge got an idea and, as a practical joke, sent a call girl up to his room.<BR>She knocked, and the old fellow walked slowly over and opened the door.  He saw a beautiful red-headed woman standing before him.<BR>"I have a birthday present for you," she said, and smiled.<BR>She leaned forward and whispered, "I'm here to give you super sex."<BR>"Thanks," he said thoughtfully, "I'll take the soup."<BR>--The Daily Oklahoman, 7/10/2000

<LI>The long line of solemn men and women advanced up the church aisle.  One by one they paused before the altar to lay bouquets on an open coffin.  All except one woman.  Instead of flowers, she set a bowl of steaming gumbo beside the dearly departed's face. "Why did you do that?" an usher asked, "This man's soup-eating days are over."  "Oh?" She replied, "You think he's still smelling the roses?"

<LI>A guy goes on a walking holiday in Ireland. One day, while out walking, he
became hungry so he decided to stop at a little cottage and ask for
something to eat. The lady of the house invited him in and served him a bowl
of soup by the fire. There was a wee pig running around the house. It kept
running up to the visitor, jumping up on him excitedly and giving him a
great deal of attention. "I've never seen a pig so friendly," said the man.
"Ah," replied the woman, "he's not that friendly. That's his bowl you're
using."  (Thanks to Steve McMullen for the contribution!)

<LI>This is embassringly awful from Karla, but here goes:
<BR>"Waiter, there is a worm floating in my pea soup!" 'The waiter is not amused. "But sir, you ordered German Pea Soup. That is the sausage!"
<P>
<LI>Frank from Vienna, Austria, offers up the following hilarious soup skit, with commentary:
<BR>"Well, this was a comedy play by two comedians and broadcast in 2002 in German TV, so I tried to translate and will give comments to the last part where one must be
aware of French language too:
<P>
Location: a plain restaurant, a customer sitting at a table, the waiter brings the
soup.
<BR>Guest: (staring into the soup) "There is a hair in my soup" (in German the word hair
is "haar" and is spoken like the german "H", so it seems only that he says hair)
<BR>
Waiter: "oh, you are right..." (bows forward and takes a big letter "H" out of the
soup). Then a voice from the "off" says: "but we were even better with this joke on our
French tour."
<BR>
The camera shows the exact first scene: restaurant, customer, waiter brings the soup.
<BR>
Customer (staring into his soup and speaking with a strong French accent):
"ser is somesing in my suup sad I can not speak out"--and he takes the letter "H" out of the soup. (French people can not speak the letter "H", it is fully soundless).
<P>
So, for me this was a joke to really laugh about. The necessary ingredients:
one is puzzled by the mixing up of "H" and "hair" (German Haar);
one is astonished to find a 15 cm large letter in the soup;
one is asking why the French joke should be better;
and we can laugh about the stupid French guys (what is still something in Germany).
Got It? I know is nearly impossible to translate."

Some day it may come back as an epic novel).  <I>Scene:  A restaurant, between noon and 1:00 p.m. on a weekday</I> :

Patron: Waiter!
<BR>
Waiter: Hi, my name is Bill, and I'll be your Support.
  What seems to be the problem?
<BR>
Patron: There's a fly in my soup!
<BR>
Waiter: Try again; maybe the fly won't be there this time.
<BR>
Patron: [looks away, then back]    No, it's still there.
<BR>
Waiter: Maybe it's the way you're using the soup.  Try eating it with a fork instead.
<BR>
Patron: [tries fork]  Even when I use the fork, the fly is still there.
<BR>
Waiter: What are your "table" settings?  Have you tried reversing the position of your knife and spoon?
<BR>
Patron: [makes the switch]   That doesn't do anything.
<BR>
Waiter: This might be a server problem. Lots of these things are server problems.
<BR>
Patron:  YOU'RE MY SERVER!  THIS IS NOT A SERVER PROBLEM!!!
<BR>
Waiter: Maybe the soup is incompatible with the bowl.  What kind of bowl are you using?
<BR>
Patron: A SOUP bowl!
<BR>
Waiter: Hmmm, that should work. Maybe it's a configuration problem.  How was the bowl set up?
<BR>
Patron: You brought it to me on a saucer.  What has that to do with the fly in my soup?!
<BR>
Waiter: Can you remember everything you did before you noticed the fly in your soup?
<BR>
Patron: I sat down and ordered the Soup of the Day!
<BR>
Waiter: Did you change the flavor settings?  Did you alter the salt or pepper content?
<BR>
Patron: No. I'm soup illiterate. I only eat it the way it comes.[sneezes]
<BR>
Waiter: Have you checked it for viruses?
<BR>
Patron: I got it from you.
<BR>
Waiter: Yes, but have you downloaded anything else into the soup?
<BR>
Patron: Just crackers.
<BR>
Waiter: And where did you get the crackers?
<BR>
Patron: FROM YOU!  THEY CAME WITH THE SOUP!!
<BR>
Waiter You did take the cellophane off first before inserting the crackers, didn't you?
<BR>
Patron: YES!!
<BR>
Waiter: They should be okay then.  Hmmm.  Have you considered upgrading to the latest Soup of the Day?
<BR>
Patron: You have more than one Soup of the Day each day??
<BR>
Waiter: Yes, the Soup of the Day is changed every hour.
<BR>
Patron: Well, what is the Soup of the Day now?
<BR>
Waiter: The current Soup of the Day is Tomato 2001.
<BR>
Patron: Fine. Bring me the tomato soup, and hurry. I'm running late now.
<BR>
[Waiter leaves and returns with another bowl of soup.]
<BR>
Waiter: Here you are, Sir. 
<BR>
Patron: This is potato soup.
<BR>
Waiter: Yes, the tomato release time had to be revised to accommodate changes to the recipe.
<BR>
Patron: Well, I'm so hungry now, I'll eat anything.
<BR>
[Waiter leaves.]
<BR>
Patron: Waiter! There's a fly in my soup!
  Waiter! Waiter!  [sees a bus boy]
Hey, you, where's my waiter?
<BR>
Bus Boy: I'm sorry; all of our waiters are currently busy. They are helping other customers.  The estimated time until your waiter is free is eighteen minutes.  
<BR>
Patron: I can't wait that long.   Listen, could you just bring me a sandwich?  I need to go and I can't leave without eating. 
<BR>
Bus Boy: Sir, I'm a bus boy.  I can't take orders or carry food.   You  could access a sandwich on our self-service help counter. 
<BR>
Patron: Please, just for me.  I'll give you an extra five dollars.
<BR>
Bus Boy: What kind of sandwich?
<BR>
Patron: Roast beef.
<BR>
Bus Boy: I'll get it for you right away.
<BR>
[Enter Waiter]
<BR>
Waiter: I'm sorry, sir, this meal has performed an illegal operation and will have to be shut down.  [Glares at the bus boy, who slinks off.  Confiscates the soup.  Hands the patron the check.] Your check, sir.
<BR>
Patron: What's this? 
"Soup of the Day $5.00... 
Upgrade to newer Soup of the Day $2.50... 
Access to Support $2.00 ...
TOTAL: $9.50 + Tax ...
Gratuity not included."
<BR>
Gratuity?!  I tell you, he's not getting more than a buck!
<BR>
Waiter:            Excuse me sir.  You forgot your fly.

<LI>George W. Bush just got a lovely birthday present from Laura--a gold-plated vacuum flask.  He put it proudly on his desk and waited for an aide to ask about it.  At last:  "what is it?" asks one.  "Laura says it keeps hot things hot and cold things cold."  "So what have you put in it?" asks the aide.  "Soup and ice cream."

<LI>What do the people at the SEC eat for lunch these days?  Enron and Cream of Mushroom soup. [Ellen Black, Washington Post, 6/16/02)

<LI>George W. Bush did something I thought was pretty interesting.  He invited Congress to a big luncheon at the White House and only, listen to this, only a third of them showed.  That seems kind of rude, doesn't it?  But be fair, who really wants to watch Dick Cheney take his soup intravenously? (David Letterman, January 2001)

<LI>In the wake of the January 2002 pretzel attack in the White House: "George W. Bush has a big weekend planned.  He's going to stay in the White House and watch television, just like he did last weekend.  He'll be just like Cheney; he'll be hooked up to an IV the whole time.  But he's going to watch football on television and he said this weekend, instead of pretzels, it'll be soup." (David Letterman)
