<BLOCKQUOTE>
In my grandmother's house there was always chicken soup<BR>
And talk of the old country--mud and boards,<BR>
Poverty,<BR>
The snow falling down the necks of lovers.
<P>
Now and then, out of her savings<BR>
She sent them a dowry.  Imagine<BR>
The rice-powdered faces!<BR>
And the smell of the bride, like chicken soup.
<P>
But the Germans killed them.<BR>
I know it's in bad taste to say it,<BR>
But it's true.  The Germans killed them all.
<P>

<P>
In the ruins of Berchtesgaden<BR>
A child with yellow hair<BR>
Ran out of a doorway.
<P>
A German girl-child---<BR>
Cuckoo, all skin and bones---<BR>
Not even enough to make chicken soup.<BR>
She sat by the stream and smiled.
<P>
Then as we splashed in the sun<BR>
She laughed at us.<BR>
We had killed her mechanical brothers,<BR>
So we forgave her.
<P>

<P>
The sun is shining.<BR>
The shadows of the lovers have disappeared.<BR>
They are all eyes; they have some demand on me---<BR>
They want me to be more serious than I want to be.
<P>
They want me to stick in their mudhole<BR>
Where no one is elegant.<BR>
They want me to wear old clothes,<BR>
They want me to be poor, to sleep in a room with many others---
<P>
Not to walk in the painted sunshine<BR>
To a summer house,<BR>
But to live in the tragic world forever.
