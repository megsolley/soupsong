<H5>It's lovely to look at--"tricolore" like the Italian flag, with the white of the potato, the orange of carrot, and the green of parsley; serve hot to 4-6 people as a first course.</H5>

Put potatoes in a large saucepan and just cover with water. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook on medium heat until the potatoes are tender.  Puree them in their liquid and set aside.
<P>
In another large saucepan, saute the onion with all the butter and oil until it is golden.  Add the carrot and turnip, and cook for 2 minutes.  Don't overcook--they've got to keep their crunch.

Pour the potatoes into the vegetables, stir in the cheese, milk, and stock, and bring to a good simmer.  Cook for a few minutes, stirring, season to taste, then remove from the heat.  Stir in the parsley, ladle into bowls, and serve immediately, passing a separate dish of freshly grated parmesan on the side.
