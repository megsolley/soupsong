<H5>For chicken liver fans everywhere!  This chunky, chewy, and complete circus of textures and flavors makes a superb meal with crustry bread or cornbread and a big salad.  It was created by Karen Stewart, a 29-year-old married financial planner with 2 dogs and no kids (yet)--with passions for cooking and painting, and in need of gardening skills as she lives on 250+ acres in rural Vermont. You'll see from this recipe that Karen cooks creatively, listening to her taste buds "and they tell
me what goes with what."  Serve hot to 6-8 people. </H5>

</UL>
<P>
In a Dutch oven, melt the butter and toss in the onion, celery, and bacon--cooking on medium high for 5-10 minutes until the bacon has rendered its fat and is getting crispy and the onion is translucent.  Toss in the chopped liver and let cook though.  Deglaze the pan with the Marsala and let simmer for a couple minutes.
<P>
Put the skinned chicken halves in the pot and pour in water, just to cover.  Add thyme, bay leaves, salt and pepper, and a good pinch of Old Bay seasoning.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, then simmer, partially covered, for 45 minutes.
<P>
Remove the chicken and let cool.  Skim fat from the top if there's a lot.  Add the potatoes and mushrooms to the soup.  Bring back to a boil, reduce, then simmer for 10 minutes.  
<P>
When the chicken is cool, strip off the meat and cut into nice big chunks.
<P>
Fifteen minutes before serving, pour in the cream and bring to a boil, add the shrimp and chicken chunks and simmer for 10 minutes.  Add a Tablespoon of butter and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and Marsala.  Ladle into bowls and bon appetit.
