<H5>You'll have to find a package of dried <I>wakame</I> to make this, but it's worth the search.  This vegetable seaweed is both delicate and meaty...and a little goes a long way.  The first time I made it, I doubted the ingredients--thought the "real" plant must have broken up in the package.  Nope.  A little water on a little piece gets REAL big. This is light but flavorful, a delicate combination of sea and land--whets your appetite.  Serve hot (preferably in lidded bowls) as a course (or for breakfast with rice and pickles) to 4 people.</H5>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI>8-inch piece of <I>wakame</I> seaweed (zero calories and full of minerals)
<LI>8 ounces <A HREF="fbeans.html">tofu</A>
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">dashi</A> (can be found in granule form)
<LI>3 Tablespoons <A HREF="sjapan.html">red (aka) miso</A>
</UL>
Soak the <I>wakame</I> in water for 15 minutes; rinse and drain; cut into 1-inch pieces.  Cut the tofu into small, bite-sized cubes.  Bring the <I>dashi</I> to a boil,then reduce to a simmer; add the <I>wakame</I> and tofu and simmer for 1 minute.
<P>
Dip out some of the hot dashi to whisk with the miso, then strain it back into the soup...and remove from the heat before it comes to a boil.
<P>
Ladle the soup evenly into the bowls (ideally hot:  from the oven if china; from hot water if laquer) and serve immediately.  Stir with chopsticks to eat, as the miso separates easily from the broth.
