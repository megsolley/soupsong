<HR>
<H5>This piquant, chunky, and low-calorie soup looks festive and is nicely filling as a lunch, served with bread and followed by a piece of fruit.  The recipe was contributed by a Floridian I know only as Roz, but who has been a great supporter of this site as well as a brainstormer on soup techniques.  Roz thinks the recipe orginally came from an article about Oprah Winfrey, but she suggests blending the soup for a finer texture.  Serve hot to 4 people for a filling lunch.  Thanks, Roz!</H5>
