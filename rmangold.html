<H5>Boy is this meaty!  And very pure, and drop dead delicious.  It's Mike Mangold's favorite soup--the recipe from his German grandmother...and it's always served on his birthday.  Mike, now in the metro Washington area, confesses that he adds ketchup to it as a seasoning:  "Hey, I'm originally from Pittsburgh," he says.  Serve hot as a marvelous meal to 6-8 people.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>1 3-pound block <A HREF="fmeat.html">rump roast of beef</A> (don't use stew meat)
<LI>1 <A HREF="fmeat.html">soup bone</A>, cracked
<LI>1 medium yellow <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A> (smaller than a tennis ball), quartered
<LI>3 stalks <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery</A> with leaves, cut in half to fit into the pot
<LI>1/2 Tablespoon <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>10 cups cold water 
<LI>2 <A HREF="fcarrot.html">carrots</A>, peeled and trimmed, and left whole
<LI>1/2 pound (4 cups) <A HREF="fpasta.html">wide egg noodles</A>, cooked separately in salted water right before serving
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A>, to taste
</UL>
<P>
Cut any fat off the block of meat and discard.  In a large soup pot, combine the meat, soup bone, onion, celery, salt, and cold water.  Bring to a boil slowly, then cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 4&#189; to 5 hours.  When the meat is about 20 minutes away from being done, add the carrots. You can begin cooking the noodles in a separate pot at this point too--when they are done, you can strain them, or just hold them off the heat. When the meat is very tender and falling apart, remove from heat.  Take out the meat and carrots and reserve, then strain the broth.  
<P>
When ready to serve, return the broth to the soup pot and bring it back to a boil.  Cut the meat and carrots into bite size pieces and add to the pot. Finally, stir in the strained noodles.  Season to taste, then let simmer another 5-10 minutes for the flavors to blend.  Ladle into bowls and pass the ketchup...or not!
