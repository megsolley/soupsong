<P>
This evergreen shrub, native to the Mediterranean region, symbolized victory and merit to the ancients.  Romans named it <I>lauris</I>, from <I>laudere</I>, to praise; accordingly it was sacred to Apollo and its leaves were used to crown the brows of poets. 
<P>
Its name "bay"--from the Anglo-Saxon--also means "crown," and Nicholas Culpepper testified in 1653 to its curative powers in his Herbal, "Neither witch nor devil, thunder nor lightning will hurt a man where a bay tree is." 
<P>
Today these shiny oblate leaves flavor soups and sauces.  They are rarely marketed fresh; in dried form, the flavor of short, oval Turkish bays are considered more subtle than their long, narrow brethren from California.
