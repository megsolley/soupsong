<HR>
<H5><I>Jocoque</I> is a Mexican-style sour cream, somewhere between salted buttermilk and a thin sour cream and ranging in taste from tangy to sharp.  What makes this soup quite unusual is its odd juxtapositions--sweet and savory, bland and piquante, liquid and solid, with unexpected textures and with a wonderfully festive look.  In fact, it's a complete surprise to eat--and in the most positive way.  It's adapted from Guadalupe Rivera's <I>Recipes and Reminiscences of Life with Frida Kahlo</I>, her stepmother.  Serve hot in flat, wide soup bowls to 4 people.  It is an excellent prelude to any number of Mexican or other main dishes.  It's a great start, in fact, to a roast or barbeque chicken.</H5>

<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>1 small <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, thinly sliced

<LI>1/4 pound <A HREF="fsquash.html">zucchini</A>, sliced in thin rounds
<LI>4-5 canned <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A>, seeded, then finely chopped and rechopped so they look like confetti in the final dish
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable</A> or <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1/4 teaspoon <A HREF="foregano.html">oregano</A>, crumbled between your palms
<LI>sprig of fresh <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>, minced
</UL>  
<P>
<I>"Under" garnish:</I>  Lightly beat 1 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg white</A> with 2 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg yolks</A>--then whip in 1 cup of <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">sour cream</A> (or <I>jocoque</I>), 2 Tablespoons of <A HREF="bthicken.html">flour</A>, and 1 Tablespoon of sugar.  Scrape into a small greased pan or baking dish (about 8" x 4") and bake in a preheated 350 F degree oven for about 20 minutes--it will puff high and slightly brown on the edges.
<P>
Make the torte first, as described in the "under" garnish.  Once you put the torte in the oven, you can begin the soup.
<P>
Heat the oil in a large saucepan and toss in the onion, carrot, and hot pepper.  Cook over medium-low until the onion is translucent.  Add the zucchini, toss for a minute--then add the minced tomato and cook until thick, stirring occasionally.  When thick, pour in the stock, crumbled in the oregano, and add the minced parsley.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.
<P>
When ready to serve, unmold the torte and cut into 4 equal pieces--placing one in each of the 4 flat, wide serving bowls.  Ladle the broth and vegetables over the torte in each bowl and serve immediately.
