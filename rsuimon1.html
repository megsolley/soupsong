<H5>Delicate but far from rarified, this "something to drink" pure soup is not so very different from egg drop soups from around the world.  It's tasty and clean, nice for a fragrant first course...or for a fussy convalescent who could use a little reminding about the preciousness of life (egg forms floating in an oceanic amniotic sac with slivered pea pods?)   Serve as a first course to 4 people, preferably in a pretty bowl (lacquer is nice) with a lid.  It's so nice to take that lid off and have that visual/aromatic impact get you right between the eyes.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>20 <A HREF="fpeas.html">pea pods</A>, slivered diagonally as finely as possible
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">Dashi</A>
<LI>1 teaspoon <A HREF="fbeans.html#soy">light soy sauce</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>2 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">eggs</A>, beaten lightly
</UL>
Parboil the slivered pea pods in lightly salted water for 1 minute, then refresh in cold water and drain.
<P>
Bring the dashi to a boil, then reduce heat and add soy sauce and salt.  
<P>
When dashi is at a simmer, toss in the slivered peas, then pour the beaten eggs--in a fine, thin stream--all over the broth, so it turns into fine shapes.  Remove from the heat immediately and ladle into soup bowls, covering with their lids.  Serve straightaway.
