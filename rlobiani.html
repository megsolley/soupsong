<HR>
<H5>This very textured soup carries explosions of unusual flavors in every mouthful.  Rich and pleasantly grainy--the marriage of ground walnuts and beans is incredible.  Serve hot to 4 as a substantial first course or as a fine meal with accompaniments.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>1/2 pound dried <A HREF="fbeans.html">red beans</A>, soaked overnight in water to cover
<LI>6 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable</A> or <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>2 <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>, finely chopped
<LI>1/4 cup <A HREF="fnuts.html">walnuts</A>, ground coarsely
<LI>1 teaspoon ground <A HREF="fcilantr.html">coriander seeds</A>
<LI>2 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, minced or pressed
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="bflavor.html">tarragon vinegar</A> (or to taste)
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A>
</UL>

Drain the beans, then pour into a saucepan with the stock and bring to a boil, skimming foam as necessary.  Reduce the heat and cook, partially covered, until soft, at least 1 and 1/2 hours.  
<P>
Meanwhile, saute the onions in the olive oil until golden.
<P>
When the beans are done, puree the soup--solids first--until it is roughly chopped.  You don't want a smooth texture.  Pour back into the saucepan and dilute with water if you think it's too thick.  Stir in the onions and simmer for a few minutes--then stir in the walnuts, coriander, garlic, and vinegar, and season with salt and pepper to taste.  Let stand at a very low heat for 10-15 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with fresh chopped cilantro and/or parsley.
