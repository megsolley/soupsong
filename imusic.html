Read on, snap your fingers, and please add your own entries along the way.  If you just want to know who has soupy NAMES, here they are:  <A HREF="http://www.thesoup.co.uk">Invisible Lead Soup</A>; The Soup Dragons; Bowling for Soup; Gazpacho (Latin swing); Alphabet Soup (rap/hip hop); Wolf Soup (jazz with lead Bob Nieske); Soup; Scull Soup; Mock Turtle (that has a 1970 album <I>Turtle Soup</I>); Hot Soup! (female trio); and DJ Soup.  Special thanks to Peter Barnes, presently IT college professor in Bury, England, for pinpointing the derivation of The Soup Dragons name:  nothing less than a main character in the British children's television series <A HREF="http://www.clangers.co.uk/home.htm">"The Clangers,"</A> launched in 1969 and still a cult classic.  The character?  <A HREF="http://www.clangers.co.uk/w2.htm">The Soup Dragon</A>, of course, a she-dragon who lives inside the Clanger planet and feeds those shocking pink Clangers red, green, and purply-blue soup that she cooks in volcanic wells.
<P>
<U>Composer Modest Moussorgsky to Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in a letter dated 8/15/1868:</U><BR>
"And another thing about German symphonic development.  I tell you, our cold <I>kvass</I> soup is a horror to the Germans, and yet we eat it with pleasure.  And their cold cherry soup is a horror to us, and yet it sends a German into ecstacy.  In short, symphonic development is just like German philosophy and soup--all worked out and systematized.  When a German thinks, he reasons his way to a conclusion.  Our Russian brother, on the other hand, starts with a conclusion and then might amuse himself with some reasoning."

        <TD>Dr. Hook </TD>
       <TD>Wonderful Soup-Stone, from <I>Sylvia's Mother</I> (1971), with lyrics by children's poet Shel Silverstein.  It goes like this:
<H6>"Hanging from a string in my momma's kitchen, back in the hard-time days<BR>

Was a little old stone 'bout the size of an apple - it was smooth and worn and grey <BR>

There wasn't much food in my momma's kitchen, so whenever things got tight <BR>

Momma'd boil up some water, put in the stone and say, 'Let's have some soup tonight' <BR>

And I swear you could taste the chicken and tomato and the noodles and the marrowbone <BR>

But it really wasn't nothin' but some water and potatoes, and the wonderful, wonderful soup-stone. <BR>

It had been in the family for a whole lotta years so we knew it was a nourishing thing <BR>

And I remember momma as she stirred it in the water, and we could all hear her sing <BR>

'It's a magical stone and as long as we got it, we'll never have a hungry night <BR>

Just add a little love to the wonderful soup-stone and everything will be all right' <P>

Chorus 
<P>
So it carried us through the darkenin' days 'til finally the sunshine came <BR>

And the soup-stone started into gathering dust, but it hung there just the same <BR>

And ever since then the food's been plenty, but every now and then I find 

That momma in the kitchen with the wonderful soup-stone drifts across my mind <BR>

And again I can taste the chicken and tomato, and the noodles and the marrowbone<BR>

But it really wasnt nothin but some water and potatoes, and the wonderful, wonderful soup-stone." </H6>
Great appreciation to mystery writer Jill McGown (<A HREF="http://www.jillmcgown.com">www.jillmcgown.com</A>), who came up with the song, the history, the lyrics, everything.  Now if only I could get Dr. Hook's "She was only 16" out of my head!

<H6>"Now some folks loves ham hocks <BR>

And some folks loves pork chops <BR>

And some folks loves vegetable soup <BR>

And Roland the Roadie loves Gertrude the Groupie, <BR>

       <TD>Chicken Soup  (1997-published in The New York Times)
<H6>Chicken soup is more than just soup.<bR>
Chicken soup is more than a meal.<bR>
Chicken soup is religion you eat with a spoon.<bR>
Chicken soup is a very big deal.
<P>
Chicken soup was created when the first hen<bR>
Walked by the first mom with a ladle.<bR>
From that encounter came this life giving broth.<bR> 
(Of course, for the bird it was fatal).
<P>
It is comfort and warmth, <bR>
"Home," in a bowl; <bR>
The bouillon of Gods, poultry scented.<bR>
The manna from heaven would have been chicken soup,<bR> 
But matzoth balls had not been invented.
<P>
Chicken soup's made with kreplach, udon <bR>
Alphabets, egg drop and rice.<bR>
It's even made with no chicken at all,<bR>
In those cubes which can double as dice.
<P>
It's served with wontons, noodles and flanken,<bR>
From China to Chile to Thailand.<bR>
From Delhi to delis, it fills the world's bellies,<bR>
In Paris, Bombay and Long Island.
<P>
It's been called an elixir, the poultry Prozac, <bR>
And of course: Jewish penicillin.<bR>
But it transcends all persuasions, <bR>
When viral invasions <bR>
And bacilli are evil villains.
<P>
It's usually best when it is brought to your sick bed, <bR>
Straight from a steamy warm kitchen.<bR>
Nose runny, bones shaking, your body all aching,<bR>
Eyes teary and red rimmed from itching.
<P>
It helps to first hear "The Chicken soup prayer:"Be careful, don't burn your lips."<bR>
And you bow your head and gratefully slurp<bR>
And you're healed with just the first sips.
<P>

You won't be thrown for a loop.<bR>
You can answer with the faith of the miraculously cured: <bR>
It did it to make chicken soup.

Green things in my soup that arent parsley<BR>

Soup was meant to be<BR>
Completely free of such extraneous debris<BR>
Except for now and then a noodle, or some rice<BR>
But these things are not nice<BR>
See them swimming, thrashing, thriving<BR>
Oh, my God, they're scuba diving<BR>
In my bouillabaisse I looked and then I<BR>
Saw a tiny face with two antennae<BR>
And thought I heard him say<BR>
The soup is good today.<BR>
I let out a whoop<BR>
I hollered, Waiter, there are strangers in my soup,<BR>
And when he came I said, Now Im a connoisseur<BR>
I ordered soupe du jour.<BR>
He said, You dont need a waiter<BR>
You need an exterminator.<BR>
You ordered soupe du jour, I knew you dug soup<BR>
This is soupe du jour--today its bug soup<BR>
That explains the group<BR>
Of strangers in your soup."</H6>

[Thanks to the wonderful perseverance of my dear friend Julia Donchi, I can be quite precise about the definition of Sch&#246;berlsuppe, an Austrian broth with dumplings stuffed with with assorted things.  The mother of Julia's student was gracious enough to provide the following: "there are several kinds of schöberl--e.g. with brain, with ham, cabbage, 
semolina or spleen (don't the austrians have a funny taste?:-( !), but the basic dumpling is sort of a biscuit made of butter, eggs (the 
egg-white is mixed until it's stiff), milk and salt, which is baked in the 
oven in a cake form, then cut into square stripes or cubes and re-heated.
In homes, schöberl are usually served on a seperate plate together with 
a beef soup, whereas in a restaurant you will get them served in the soup 
itself.]
