<H5><U>Henry IV, part 1, I, 2</U>:<BR>

FALSTAFF:       No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
        prologue to an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> and <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>.
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 1</U>:<BR>
COSTARD:   An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
        have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
        remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
        purse of wit, thou <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">pigeon-egg</A> of discretion.
<P>
<U>As You Like It, III, 2</U>:<BR>
TOUCHSTONE:      Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>, all
        on one side.
<P>
<U>Troilus and Cressida, I, 2</U>:<BR>
PANDARUS:      Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
        an addle <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>.<BR>
CRESSIDA:        If you love an addle <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> as well as you love an idle
        head, you would eat <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">chickens i' the shell</A>.
<P>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
PAROLLES (slandering, unwittingly, the very Lord Dumain asking the question):        He will steal, sir, an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> out of a cloister: for
        rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
        professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
        is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
        such volubility, that you would think truth were a
        fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
        be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
        harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
        know his conditions and lay him in straw.
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, III, 1</U>:<BR>
MERCUTIO:    Thy head is as full of quarrels as an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> is full of
        meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
        an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> for quarrelling.
<P>
<U>King Lear, I, 4</U>:<BR>
FOOL:   No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
        I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
        and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
        to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>,
        nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.
<P>
...Why, after I have cut the <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> i' the middle, and eat
        up the meat, the two crowns of the <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>. When thou
        clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
        both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
        the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
        when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
        like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
        finds it so.
<P>
EDGAR:   Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
        So many fathom down precipitating,
        Thou'dst shiver'd like an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>: but thou dost breathe;
        Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
        Ten masts at each make not the altitude
        Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
        Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again. (IV, 6)
<P>
<U>Macbeth, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
FIRST MURDERER:    What, you <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>!
        [Stabbing Macduff's young son]
       <A HREF="fmeat.html"> Young fry</A> of treachery!
<P>
<U>Coriolanus, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
CORIOLANUS:   O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
        Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
        Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
        Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
        Unseparable, shall within this hour,
        On a dissension of a doit, break out
        To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
        Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
        To take the one the other, by some chance,
        Some trick not worth an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>, shall grow dear friends
        And interjoin their issues. So with me:
        My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
        This enemy town. 
<P>
