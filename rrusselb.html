<H5>You've got to be attentive to the calendar for this one, needing a month before Passover to make the sour beet juice that gives the soup its distinctive flavor.  But very much worth it.  Traditionally served during Passover week, this soup is tasty and filling:  the tender brisket slices and delicate potato are set off perfectly by the eggy, sweet-tart broth.  Serve hot as a meal to 6 people. </H5>
<HR>
<P>
<H5>TO MAKE THE SOUR BEET JUICE <I>(RUSSEL)</I>
<UL>
<LI>4 medium <A HREF="fbeet.html">beets</A>, trimmed of greens, scrubbed, and quartered
<LI>5 cups boiled water, cooled to lukewarm
</UL>
Place the scrubbed and quartered beets in a pottery, porcelain, or glass crock with a tight-fitting lid.  Pour in the lukewarm water--it must come at least 2 inches above the tops of the beets.  Cover and let stand in a warm place for about 4 weeks.  It's fine if a leathery mold crust develops--it can just be lifted off when you are ready to use the juice.
<P>
TO MAKE THE SOUP
<UL>
<LI>2-pound piece of <A HREF="fmeat.html">beef brisket</A>
<LI>2 <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>, chopped fine
<LI>2 teaspoons <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>4 <A HREF="fbay.html">bay leaves</A>
<LI>5 cups cold water
<LI>6 medium <A HREF="fpotato.html">potatoes</A>, unpeeled
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="fbeet.html"><I>russel</I></A> (above)
<LI><A HREF="fsugar.html">sugar</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A>, to taste
<LI>3 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">eggs</A>, beaten
</UL>
<I>Garnish:</I>  chopped <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>
<P>
Combine the meat, onion, salt, and bay leaves in a large pot and stir in the cold water.  Slowly bring to a boil over medium high heat, then reduce to medium-low, cover, and let boil slowly for about 2 and 1/2 hours, until the meat is tender.  
<P>
Thirty minutes before you are ready to serve the soup, add the unpeeled potatoes to a pot of boiling water and boil until they are tender.  Peel under cold water, then keep warm until ready to serve.
<P>
When the meat is tender, stir in the <I>russel</I>, sugar, and pepper and simmer for 20 minutes.  Remove the meat to a cutting board and let cool briefly while you beat the eggs and pour them, stirring constantly, into the soup.  Remove the soup from the heat.  Slice the brisket.
<P>
To assemble, put one potato and several slices of brisket into each soup plate, then pour the hot soup over them.  Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately.</H5>
