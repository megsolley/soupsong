<P>
 Once upon a time there was a teeny-tiny woman who lived
 in a teeny-tiny house in a teeny-tiny village. Now, one day
 this teeny-tiny woman put on her teeny-tiny bonnet, and went out of
her teeny-tiny house to take a teeny-tiny walk. And when this
teeny-tiny woman had gone a teeny-tiny way, she came to a teeny-tiny  gate; so the teeny-tiny woman opened the teeny-tiny gate, and
 went into a teeny-tiny churchyard. And when this teeny-tiny
 woman had got into the teeny-tiny churchyard, she saw a teeny-tiny
 bone on a teeny-tiny grave, and the teeny-tiny woman said to her
 teeny-tiny self, "This teeny-tiny bone will make me some teeny-tiny
 soup for my teeny-tiny supper." So the teeny-tiny woman put the
 teeny-tiny bone into her teeny-tiny pocket, and went home to her
 teeny-tiny house.
<P>
 Now when the teeny-tiny woman got home to her teeny-tiny
 house, she was a teeny-tiny bit  tired; so she went up her teeny-tiny
 stairs to her teeny-tiny bed, and put the teeny-tiny bone into a teeny-
 tiny cupboard. And when this teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep
 a teeny-tiny time, she was awakened by a teeny-tiny voice from the
 teeny-tiny cupboard, which said:

 <CENTER><H5>"Give me my bone!"</H5></CENTER>

 And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny frightened, so she hid
 her teeny-tiny head under the teeny-tiny clothes and went to sleep
 again. And when she had been to sleep again a teeny-tiny time, the
 teeny-tiny voice again cried out from the teeny-tiny cupboard a
 teeny-tiny louder.

<CENTER><H4>"Give me my bone''</H4></CENTER>

 This made the teeny-tiny woman a teeny-tiny more frightened, so
she hid her teeny-tiny head a teeny-tiny further under the teeny-tiny
clothes. And when the teeny-tiny woman had been to sleep again a
teeny-tiny time, the teeny-tiny voice from the teeny-tiny cupboard
said again a teeny-tiny louder:

<CENTER><H2>"Give me my bone!"</H2></CENTER>

 And this teeny-tiny woman was a teeny-tiny bit more frightened,
but she put her teeny-tiny head out of the teeny-tiny clothes, and said
in her loudest teeny-tiny voice, <CENTER><H1>"TAKE IT!"</H1></CENTER>
