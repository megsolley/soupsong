Heat the oil in a large pot and saute the onions and garlic until soft.  Add the tomatoes, cut up, the cilantro, and the cayenne pepper.  Cook down for 10-15 minutes.  Add water and reserved tomato juice, bring to a boil, then add fava beans.  Reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours.

Pour in the chickpeas and the diced potatoes, reboil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  When ready to serve, add the oregano, by rubbing it between your palms, and season to taste.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately.
