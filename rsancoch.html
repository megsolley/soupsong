"I never expected to see our favorite dish--<I>Sancocho</I>--featured in this
eagerly anticipated newsletter.  We not only eat this at New Year's but also at any
other time when we want to make our Dominican family and/or guests feel special. 
Your recipe is very close to the one we have used for years but we also add diced
tomatoes and achiote (annato) for color and adobo (with pleny of garlic) for a
wonderful and unique flavor." </H5>

Boy, is this soup good--piquant, savory, intensely meaty, and bursting with color and 
flavor.  Sandra Takaki sent me the recipe, and here's what she says about it: "<I>Sancocho </I>is one of those comfort foods that we eat especially around 
Christmas. The night to eat it (or morning, as you see fit) is New 
Years, after a night of celebrating.  One can eat a bowl right before going 
to sleep, and then eat the leftovers the next day.  It is, as we say, 
<I>levanta muertos</I>--or ‘raises the dead.’  The truth behind <I>sancocho</I> is that it is made, like many soups, with whatever you have at hand. This is one version of it, but there are many 
versions.  Normally I have chicken in my house, so I just make it with 
chicken, and if I have chorizo  I will put some in. If I have 
potatoes, maybe I will put them in as well. In the Dominican Republic the best 
sancocho is the <I>Sancocho de 7 carnes</I> (7-meat Sancocho) which is 
really meat from 4 different animals (one is always goat), but sausages are 
counted as different meats.  ...So enjoy, and <I>Buen Provecho</I>!"  Serve hot as a meal to 6 lucky people.

1.  Make a marinade of the sour orange juice, herbs, garlic, and salt 
and pepper. Turn all the meats in it, cover, and let marinate at least 2 
hours (or overnight in the fridge), turning every 30 minutes. 
<P>
2.  Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven.  Drain the meats, reserving the 
marinade, and add them to the pot, browning on all sides.  Stir in the 
marinade and a little stock to scrape up and dissolve the flavorful 
brown bits on the bottom of the pot.  Pour in the rest of the stock and 
bring to a boil.  Add all the vegetables, return to a boil, then reduce 
heat, cover, and let simmer for 1-2 hours. The longer it is simmered, 
Sandra says, the better...and I agree.
<P>
3.  If you plan to serve with rice, start it while the soup is cooking.
<P>
4.  When ready to serve, add salt and pepper to taste.  If you want a 
thick texture, you may puree some of the vegetables and pour the puree 
back into the soup...but what a shame to cover up the brilliance and 
texture of these colorful chunks of veggies.  Ladle into deep bowls, adding 
1 or 2 tbsp of rice.  A couple of drops of <A HREF="fpepper.html">hot sauce</A> does bring out the 
taste.  To echo Sandra, <I>buen provecho</I>!
