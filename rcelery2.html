Celery raw<BR>
Develops the jaw.<BR>
But celery stewed<BR>
Is more quietly chewed.<BR>

<H5>Intensely and thickly celery, for you rabbits out there; earthy when hot for winter meals--but clean and refreshingly cold for the dog days.  Serve hot or cold to 4-6 people as a first course.</H5>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>1 bunch of <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery</A> with leaves, chopped
<LI>1 large <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, chopped
<LI>6 cups of light <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable</A> or <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1 <A HREF="fpotato.html">potato</A>, peeled and grated
<LI>1 handful of <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>, chopped
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">white pepper</A>
<LI>1/2 cup whipping <A HREF="bthicken.html#cream">cream</A>
</UL>
Saute celery and onion in 2-3 Tablespoons of <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A> over medium heat, until they take on a little color.  Stir in the stock and bring to a boil. Grate in the potato, reduce heat, and simmer for 30-45 minutes.  When ready to puree, throw in the parsley, stir for a minute, then puree in a blender or processor.  Season to taste with salt and white pepper, with more salt if you're going to serve it cold.  Stir in the whipping cream.
<P>
If you're serving the soup hot, ladle it into bowls and top with a celery leaf.  If cold, chill--then ladle into bowls and top with a little finely chopped celery and leaves--to give it a little crunch.
