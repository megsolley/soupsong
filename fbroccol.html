Broccoli is one of the oldest members of the <A HREF="fcabbage.html">cabbage</A> family.  Greeks and Romans were eating it more than 2000 years ago.
<P>
Its leaves contain much more vitamin A that the buds--and are definitely worth eating.
<P>
In late 20th century America it became a cause celebre when President George Bush publicly declared that he did not like it and would not eat it.  Roy Blount, Jr., agreed, saying in <I>Against Broccoli</I>, "The local groceries are all out of broccoli, Loccoli."
