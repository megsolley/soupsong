<H5>I tell you, I made this out of spite--it sounded so bizarre.  And while I was making it, my misgivings deepened.  And yet, it was SO GOOD.  Sour, intense, hot, and fragrant--I kept dipping into the pot and eating another bowl until it was entirely gone.  Serve hot as a first course to 4-6 people to stimulate appetites--or serve to 1 big pig like myself, after a hard day at work followed by a peevish evening over the stove.</H5>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI>6 <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic cloves</A>, chopped
<LI>2 Tablespoons chopped <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro stems</A>
<LI>2 stalks <A HREF="flemong.html">lemon grass</A> (bottom 6-8 inches only), finely sliced
<LI>3 <A HREF="fshallot.html">shallots</A>, sliced
<LI>4 Tablespoons peeled and chopped <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger root</A> (<A HREF="fgalanga.html">galangal</A>, preferably, if you can get it)
<LI>1/2 teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">white pepper</A>
<LI>2 13.5-ounce cans <A HREF="fcoconut.html">coconut milk</A> (I like the Chaokoh brand)
<LI>3/4 pound skinless, boned <A HREF="fmeat.html">chicken breasts</A>, sliced into strips
<LI>5 Tablespoons <A HREF="bflavor.html#serendipity">fish sauce</A> (<I>Nam Pla</I> or Vietnamese <I>Nuoc Mam</I>)
<LI>5 Tablespoons <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lime juice</A>

</UL>
<I>Garnish:</I>  5 <A HREF="fpepper.html">red chilies</A> (the little fiery Tabasco-types); 7 <A HREF="fcitrus.html">Kaffir lime leaves</A>, shredded--or 1/2 teaspoon grated lime zest; and 2 Tablespoons finely chopped <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro leaves</A>
<P>
 Put the garlic, cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, ginger, and pepper in a blender and process it into as much of a paste as you can.
<P>
Open the cans of coconut milk and carefully spoon off the top half of thick milk into a large saucepan (leaving the thin milk behind).  Bring this thick milk to a boil, then add the spice paste and stir over high heat  for about 5 minutes.  Add the chicken strips and continue stirring for a couple minutes, until the chicken is no longer pink.  Add the rest of the coconut milk (the thin part on the bottom), bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for a minute or two.
<P>
When ready to serve, stir in the lime juice and fish sauce and reheat.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with chilies, finely shredded Kaffir lime leaves (or zest), and cilantro.
