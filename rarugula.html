<HR>
<H5>Don't be put off if you are generally not a fan of this peppery green.  This cold soup is delicately flavored, refreshing, and addictive--like a cool beginning to an early summer day.  Serve cold in small portions to 4 people--or be generous with this jewel green soup to yourself and a good friend.</H5>

<LI>1 cup <A HREF="bthicken.html#cream">heavy cream</A>

<I>Garnish:</I>  fresh thyme and either arugula flower blossoms or minced arugula leaves
<P>
Saute the scallions in the olive oil until translucent, Stir in the arugula leaves and 1 cup of the stock.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cook, covered, just until the leaves wilt, a minute or two.  Remove from heat and puree in a blender until the mixture is very smooth.
<P>
Heat the remaining stock in the saucepan, then pour in the arugula puree.  Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, and don't allow to boil.  Remove from heat, stir in the cream, season to taste, then chill until icy cold.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the chopped thyme and either the minced arugula or the arugula blossoms.  Because of the jewel green color, this soup is especially nice in glass bowls.
