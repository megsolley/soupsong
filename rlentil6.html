<HR>
<H5>This creamy, delicate, but substantial soup is traditionally served in Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states to break the fast each night during the <A HREF="z71100.html">month of Ramadan</A>.  It's pretty yummy at any time of the year, but certainly sustaining during Ramadan--simple but thirst quenching and full of protein to those who have refrained from all food and liquid from sunrise to sunset.  Serve hot to 4 people to break the fast--or as a substantial first course to a family dinner.</H5>
<HR>

<H5><UL>
<LI>4 cups water
<LI>1 pound <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb</A> with bones
<LI>1 <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, chopped fine
<LI>3/4 cup <A HREF="flentil.html">red lentils</A>, rinsed
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpepper.html">pepper</A>, to taste
<LI>optional:  spices and vegetables that are on hand (these could include any combination of tomato, garlic, carrot, celery, potato, rice, chickpeas, chili peppers, leeks, cumin, paprika, safrron, cardamom, turmeric, cinnamon, or mint)
</UL>
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  minced <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A> or <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro</A>, finely minced, and <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lemon juice</A>
<P>
Put all ingredients into a large saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 2 hours.  Stir from time to time so the lentils don't stick to the bottom of the pot. When the soup is done, pick out the lamb and cut into small pieces, discarding the bones.  Stir the meat back into the soup, season to taste, and ladle into bowls.  Squeeze lemon juice directly onto each serving, then sprinkle with finely minced parsley and/or cilantro.</H5>
