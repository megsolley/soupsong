<H5><I>"Must be abstemious to sing," Bloom thinks, lunching in the Ormond and listening to Si Dedalus, Stephen's father, singing.  "Jenny Lind soup:  stock, sage, raw eggs, half-pint of cream.  For creamy dreamy."</I><BR>--James Joyce, <I>Ulysses</I></H5>

<H5>I had to make it to believe it.  Not as bad as I thought, but not exactly the "creamy dreamy" that Bloom rhapsodizes.  In fact, decidedly looking like wall paper paste--and it's just plain odd to have plain whipped egg white on top, nothwithstanding its roots in <A HREF="sfrance.html#eggwhite">French <I>cuisine de famille</I></A>.  Savory, pleasantly thick, a little goes a long way.  Serve hot to 4 people as a first course.  </H5>

<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="bflavor.html">butter</A>
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="bthicken.html">flour</A>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>4 ounces <A HREF="fcheese.html">Gruy&#232;re cheese</A>, grated
<LI>&#188; teaspoon <A HREF="fsage.html">sage</A>, crumbled

Stew the rutabaga in water until completely soft, then mash completely. 
<P>
Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour, and cook into a roux for several minutes.  Whisk in the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
<P>
Whip the egg whites and set aside.
<P>
When about ready to serve, whisk the cheese, rutabaga, and sage into the soup.  Cook over medium heat for a couple minutes, then remove from heat and stir in the heated cream.  Season to taste.  Last, whisk in the egg yolk and pour into soup plates, topping with a spoonful of the beaten egg whites.
