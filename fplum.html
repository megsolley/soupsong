<I>Life's a pudding full of plums</I><BR>--W. S. Gilbert, "The Gondoliers," Act I (1889)
<P>
<BR>
<I>Nostalgic for plum<BR>I bow among white flowers<BR>and the tears begin</I>

<I>Little Jack Horner sat in the corner<BR>Eating a Christmas pie.<BR>He put in his thumb, and pulled out a plum,<BR>And cried, "What a good boy am I!"</I><BR>--old nursery rhyme
<P>
<BR>
<I>Shall I come see<BR>plum blossoms in every stream<BR>and wet my sleeves<BR>in unpluckable water<BR>as I do now?</I>
<BR>--Lady Ise (late 9th century Japan)
<P>
<I>If you would like to know just why
 We loved each other all thro' plums,<BR>
 I'll tell you how it came about,<BR>
 If you would like to know just why.<BR>
 Love always comes while we're asleep,<BR>
 If we're dark and of either sex!<BR>
 In two or three words this is how<BR>
 We fell in love all about plums!<P>
 
 A fine big orchard uncle had,<BR>
 And I had well, a cousin sweet!<BR>
 We loved each other unawares.<BR>
 A fine big orchard uncle had.<BR>
 And the birds all went there to eat.<BR>
 For the spring there prepared their meals.<BR>
 A fine big orchard uncle had,<BR>
 And I had well, a cousin sweet!<P>
 
 One fine morn we went for a walk<BR>
 In the orchard with fair Mariette,<BR>
 All loving and gay and refreshed.<BR>
 One fine morn we went for a walk.<BR>
 The cricket and his little friends<BR>
 Expressly hummed a hymn for us;<BR>
 One fine morning we sauntered forth<BR>
 In the orchard with fair Mariette.<P>
 
 On ev'ry side, from here and there,<BR>
 The birds were singing on the branches,<BR>
 In ev'ry note upon the scale.<BR>
 On ev'ry side, from here and there,<BR>
 The fields in holiday attire,<BR>
 Were bedecked with buttercups.<BR>
 On ev'ry side, from here and there,<BR>
 The birds were singing on the branches.<P>
 
 After we reached the orchard wall,<BR>
 My cousin glanced up at the plums<BR>
 And some of them she'd like to eat,<BR>
 After we reached the orchard wall.<BR>
 The plum tree, which was low, she shook,<BR>
 Letting fall just a few of them,<BR>
 After we reached the orchard wall,<BR>
 My cousin glanced up at the plums.<P>
 
 She picked up one, and took a bit,<BR>
 And off'ring me: "Take it", she said.<BR>
 Surprised, my heart went beating fast,<BR>
 She picked up one, and took a bit.<BR>
 Her little white teeth on the edge<BR>
 Had made marks just like dainty point-lace;<BR>
 She picked up one, and took a bit,<BR>
 And off'ring me: "Take it", she said.<P>
 
 That was all, but it was enough;<BR>
 That small fruit told me lots of secrets;<BR>
 (oh, had I known that which I know!)<BR>
 That was all, but it was enough.<BR>
 I bit it, as you may believe,<BR>
 In the marks of her ruby lips:<BR>
 That was all, but it was enough;<BR>
 That small fruit told me lots of secrets.<P>
 
 Yes, ladies, thus it came about.<BR>
 We loved each other all through plums:<BR>
 Do not think it was otherwise.<BR>
 Yes, ladies, thus it came about.<BR>
 If in your midst there may be some<BR>
 Who have understood a diff'rent way,<BR>
 So much the worse! For that was how<BR>
 We loved each other all through plums.

<HR>
Cultivated since prehistoric times, this drupe of the <I>Prunus</I> family was said to have been introduced into Greece from Syria or Persia by Alexander the Great himself.  The European <I>Prunus domestica</I>, in fact, is thought to be a hybrid of <I>Prunus cerasifera</I> (the cherry plum) and <I>Prunus spinosa</I> (the sloe).
<P>
From Greece the plum spread throughout most of the temperate zone--and was planted in Massachusettes after an order was placed in 1629. American poet Helen Chasin says this about "The Word <I>Plum</I>":
<BLOCKQUOTE><H5>The word <I>plum</I> is delicious
<P>
pout and push, luxury of<BR>
self-love, and savoring murmur
<P>
full in the mouth and falling<BR>
like fruit
<P>
taut skin<BR>
pierced, bitten, provoked into<BR>
juice, and tart flesh
<P>
question<BR>
and reply, lip and tongue<BR>
of pleasure.</H5></BLOCKQUOTE>
William Carlos Williams says this in "This is Just to Say" (1934):
<BLOCKQUOTE><H5>I have eaten<BR>
the plums<BR>
that were in<BR>
the icebox<P>

and which<BR>
you were probably<BR>
saving<BR>
for breakfast<P>

Forgive me<BR>
they were delicious<BR>
so sweet <BR>
and so cold</H5></BLOCKQUOTE>

Other varieties of plum include:
<OL>
<LI><I>Prunus italica</I> (greengages), which are still found wild in Asia Minor and were possibly introduced to northern Europe by the Romans.  They disappeared entirely from Europe in the Middle Ages and were not reintroduced until the 18th century.
<LI><I>Prunus salicina</I> and <I>Prunus triflora</I> (Japanese plums), which are larger, cone-shaped, mild and sweet, and range in color from gold to orange-red.
<LI><I>Prunus institia</I> (damsons), which originated in Damascus, Syria, and were brought to Europe during the Crusades, in the 12th century--possibly by the French Duc d'Anjou after his pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
<LI><I>Prunus cerasifera</I> (cherry plums, or myrobalan), which originated in the Balkans, Caucasus, and Western Asia and were introduced to England in the 16th century--thence to the New World.
<LI><I>Prunus maritima</I> (American beach plums), which are native to the U.S. and were consumed by Native Americans before being adopted by European Settlers.
<LI><I>Prunus americana</I> (wild plums), which are native to North America.
</OL>
To this day, plums remain an important part of Azerbaijani cuisine--and they are notorious made into <I>slivovitz</I>, the potent Hungarian and central European brandy--and the French liqueur <I>Mirabelle</I>, which last was unforgettably introduced to me by Danielle Moreau in Tours and her family in Azay-le-Rideau.

Compare these to Thingazar Sayadaw's story 14, of his famous <A HREF="sburma.html">Burmese Monk's Tales</A>:   Aloft the Plum Tree:
<BLOCKQUOTE><H5><I>Prologue: One morning, after the learned monks had eaten the alms
 food offered by him, King Mindon bewailed the fact that not one among
 his teachers had become an arahat. "My lords," said the king, ''I build
 you fine monasteries and I offer you aIms food regularly. In return,
 you do show me the way to piety, but I feel poorly recompensed, for
 no one among my lords has striven enough to reach the state of arahatship." All the other monks remained silent, but the Thingazar Sayadaw
 could not let the king's criticism pass unchallenged. "Your Majesty,"
he replied, "we are aloft the plum tree and you are criticizing us from
 the ground."</I>
<P>
 Two travelers were making a perilous journey. One was tall and
 strong, whereas the other was small and weak. They had to pass
 through, first, a forest full of thieves and robbers and, second,
 another forest full of tigers and leopards. Singlehanded, the Tall
 Man fought the violent robbers and the ferocious animals while the

 Small Man merely looked on. Then the two companions had to pass
 through a long stretch of waterless desert, and, when halfway across
 it, the Small Man lay down on the sand and moaned, "Brother, I
 can go no farther. So leave me here to die." But the Tall Man
 pointed towards a clump of trees in the distance and said, "Brother,
 we must be nearly through the desert, because yonder are some
 trees. Perhaps they are plum trees, in which case we can quench

 our thirst by sucking the juice of their plums." Encouraged by these
 words, the Small Man continued the journey, only to fall down
 again later, overcome by the heat and thirst.
 The Tall Man picked up his exhausted companion and carried
 him in his arms until they reached the fringe of the desert and
 came to the trees. As the Tall Man had expected, they were plum
 trees. The Tall Man swiftly climbed one of the trees, but he found
it difficult to pick the plums, as the branches were too thorny and
 brittle. As he paused aloft the plum tree, the Small Man shouted
 from below, "You lazy fellow, you cowardly fellow! You call your-
self a man, yet you cannot even get a few plums!"</H5>
