<HR>
<H5>I really like this soup.  It's chunky and full of interesting textures--very pure--and with a knockout combination of flavors.  The pureness of the tomatoes really serves up the unusual combination of licorice (the fennel and basil) and saffron.  Don't skimp on the latter--it's sensational.  Serve hot to 6 as a first course or as a luncheon soup. </H5>

In a large pot, heat the 4 Tablespoons of oil then saute the chopped onions, fennel, and garlic over medium low heat for about 10 minutes.  Pour in the wine and macerated saffron, then stir in the basil.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for a minute or two.  Add the chopped tomatoes, their juice, and the water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, partially covered.

When ready to serve, salt and pepper to taste, then stir in the basil and fennel feathers.  Ladle into bowls and have at.</H5>
