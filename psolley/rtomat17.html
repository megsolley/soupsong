<H5>Light, fragrant, tart, and subtle, this light soup is an excellent appetite stimulant, both hot and cold.  It's simple to make and makes a beautiful and sophisticated presentation.  Dear friend Sandy Bentley of Minonk, Illinois, suggested this recipe to me.  She likes it hot with chicken stock; I'm wild about it cold with beef stock.  And it's not at all bad with a splash of vodka at the end either!  Serve hot or cold as a first course to 4 people. </H5>

In a saucepan, bring the tomato juice, onion, celery, bay leaf, and cloves to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes.  Strain, stir in the stock, and reheat.  
<P>
If serving hot, ladle into cups and float the lemon slice on top of each portion (this works the best if you gently lower it flat to the surface on a spoon).  If serving cold, overseason a little bit while warm, then chill in the refrigerator until ice cold.  Ladle into cups and float the lemon slice on top of each.
