       <TD>Tom Note, radio reporter for several NYC stations, reports on the World Trade Center attack, noting "The tragedy defies superlatives; radio and even television are limited severely in their abilities to describe more than the surface facts when things are this enormous. When the superhuman efforts of the fire department and other rescue personnel started to take their toll on exhausted bodies, St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village sent out an urgent plea. More than blood, more than money, what was needed was soup to keep these heroic women and men going, as well as insulated coffee pitchers to pour it from. Soup would keep longer, be transported more easily, and pack more nutrients into less volume than other comestibles. (There was also a call for Baby Wipes and tissues as the acrid smoke needed to be constantly wiped from burning eyes. Several other items you might not associate with rescue efforts were additionally requested, however soup and Baby Wipes seemed to be at the top of most lists for the first three days after the attack). As of Saturday the call for soup and other food and item donations has been called off, as a steady supply line of most necessary items has been established."
