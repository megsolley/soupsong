<H5>Also called "The Dolly Parton diet," for reasons that are shrouded in mystery, this 7-day diet really does work--in the short term, anyway.  And there's a great purity to it--especially in the summertime when it's wonderfully refreshing served ice cold.  Ingredient proportions can be varied according to your likes and dislikes.  If you're interested in recent studies on the efficacy of soup in diets, click <A HREF="sdiet.html">HERE</A>. 
<P>
If you're interested in going gourmet AND losing weight, try the following suggestions, recommended by Bobbi B. from California:  "To make the soup not so...so...impossible to eat three times a day; try making the first batch with red onions, red cabbage and red bell peppers, leave it chunky like a minestrone. The second batch make with yellow onions, green cabbage & green bells (I left out the tomatoes in second batch) and pure&#233; it. The taste and texture change makes it so much more palatable. Also, on the skim milk day; add non fat plain yogurt to the soup as one of glasses of milk...tastes wonderful!!! Hey! I lost 10 lbs. in 7 days, I feel great! I can't imagine it not being healthy for you, keep the foods fresh and be creative when you cook."<P>
Or how about chef Karen Larkin who makes soups from scratch every morning at her McKinleyville, California, caf&#233;:  "I love this diet! It really works! I add a few different herbs and spices to each batch to give it an international twist. For example, I add chopped cilantro, a little chili powder, and cumin to give it a Southwestern flavor; some oregano, basil, and fresh garlic for an Italian taste; a little curry powder mixed into the cooking soup and chopped fresh mint leaves for garnish on top when serving to give it a unique Moroccan flavor; shrimp or fish boullion, a little soy sauce, and some fresh bean sprouts, minus the tomatoes for an exotic Oriental sensation; chanterelle mushrooms and a pinch of thyme and rosemary minus the tomatoes for a wonderful French taste. All very yummy!"
