<H5>One of the most requested soups on my site--this one is from Abruzzo and features the meatballs traditional to that part of Italy.  It's a pretty soup, and very substantial with all those meatballs.  The torn escarole floats on the broth, enriched by the meat and molten cheese.  Flavorful yet subtle.  Something to throw a bouquet about.  Serve hot to 6 people. (For nonbridal occasions, it can be a proper meal for 4.)</H5>

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.  
<P>
Mix the veal, sirloin, egg, bread crumbs, parsley, 1/2 cup grated cheese, salt, and pepper until uniform, but don't overwork.  Form into small meatballs (like really big marbles)--about 50 of them--arrange on a baking sheet, and cook at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.  They should still be tender, not too brown.  Drain off the fat and let them drain on paper towels.
<P>
When ready to serve, bring the stock to a boil in a large pot.  Add the torn escarole, cover, and boil for 5 minutes.  Add the meatballs, reduce heat, and bring to a simmer.  Let simmer for a few minutes, then stir in the remaining 1/4 cup grated cheese.  Serve immediately--sprinkling with more cheese, if you like.
