<HR>
<H5>Possibly the most refreshing and beautiful summer soup you can find, not to mention lo-cal.  It gleams like a jewel, slides down the throat coldly, and yet is robust and robustly flavored--very savory before roasted or barbequed meats.  Serve cold to 4 as a first course.</H5>

Cooked the peeled and chopped beets in the water until tender, then remove and reserve them.  Add the stock, vinegar, celery seeds, and dill to the beet broth, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer on low for 10 minutes.  Strain through coffee filters and return to the saucepan.
<P>
Mix the gelatin mixture into the broth and stir to dissolve completely.  Add beets, cover, and chill until syrupy.  Stir well, cover again, and chill until firm.
<P>
When ready to serve, break up the mixture with a spoon, then ladle into small cups.  Spoon yoghurt into each cup, sprinkle with the fresh herb, and spear a lemon sliver into the top.
