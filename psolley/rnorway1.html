<H5>Sweet and tart, chunky and many textured, this soup is extraordinarily rich--and excellent when you want to mainline the energy and flavor of concentrated fruit.  Good hot or cold or even frozen.  Serve hot or cold to 6-8 people as a meal (especially breakfast) with bread, as a first course, or as an accompaniment to a meat course.  Also, you can partially freeze it and serve it with cream for dessert.  Talk about versatile!</H5>
