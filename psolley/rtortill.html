<H5>There are as many different recipes for this classic Mexican soup as there are Mexican cooks...and enthusiasts.  Actor <A HREF="bfaves.html">Matt Broderick</A> is one of the latter, as captured in Paul Newman's <I>Own Cookbook</I>, but this isn't his recipe--all the chili powder and cumin he recommends just overwhelms the soup to my mind.  This one uses the <I>ancho</I> chile of Michoac&#225;n.  You want even hotter?  Use hotter chiles.  Also, I've selected a "pretty" combination of garnishes--but, traditionally, you can just use whatever cheese, vegetables, even chicken that you've got around.  It's the presentation of all these garnishes that makes it such a showstopper. Serve hot to 4 as a substantial first course or as lunch.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A> (<A HREF="fmeat.html">lard</A>, if you want to be traditional)
<LI>1 <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, sliced
<LI>3 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, left whole
<LI>4 canned <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A> (about half a 15-ounce can), drained
<LI>6 cups stock--<A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken</A> is traditional, but <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable</A> is fine
<LI>1 dried <A HREF="fpepper.html"><I>ancho</I> chile</A>
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnishes:</I> fried <A HREF="bgarnish.html">corn tortillas</A>; small cubes of fresh <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A> (<I>queso fresco</I> or farmer's cheese) or Monterey Jack; fine chopped <A HREF="favocado.html">avocado</A>; fine chopped <A HREF="fpepper.html">red pepper</A>, wedges of <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lime</A>; and crumbled <A HREF="fpepper.html"><I>ancho</I></A>.
<P>
First cut off the stem of the <I>ancho</I>, cut it in half, and throw out the seeds.  Reserve 1/4 of the dried chile to use as garnish, then soak the rest of it in hot water.
<P>
In a large saucepan, saute onion and garlic in oil over medium heat until they are golden brown--as much as 12 minutes.  Puree with the tomatoes and soaked <I>ancho</I>, then pour back into the saucepan with the stock.  Bring to a boil, then let simmer for 30 minutes.  Season to taste with salt.
<P>
While broth is simmering, prepare tortillas.  Traditionally, you cut day-old or dried-out corn tortillas in half, then slice the halves into thin strips--fry them on both sides in 1/3 cup of hot oil, until crisp--then drain.  If time is of the essence, you can cheat with store bought.
<P>
When ready to serve, arrange cubed cheese and chopped pepper and chopped avocado in 4 flat soup bowls, then ladle over the broth, sprinkle each with the crumbled <I>ancho</I>, top with a mound of fried tortillas and serve with a lime wedge.  The lime is important!
<P>
You could, of course, do all of this at the table for a truly dramatic presentation.
