<H5>Traditionally served after an all-night party to fend off next-day hangovers, this hearty soup is awfully good in a sour meaty way for a cosy winter dinner.  The potatoes are my idea--you can omit them if you want to be a purist.  Serve hot to to 6-8 people as a meal</H5>

Boil the smoked meat in water for at least 30 minutes, letting it cool in the broth.  When cool, cut the meat into pieces and discard the bone, reserving the liquid.

Melt the butter in a saucepan, toss in the onions and cook until golden.  Take the pan off the heat, add the paprika, and stir.  Add the Tablespoons of water and the sauerkraut, and put back on the heat, stirring.  Pour in the sauerkraut juice and stock, bring to a boil, and add the potatoes, bay leaf, pepper, and the smoked meat pieces.  Reduce the heat and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
