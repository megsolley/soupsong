<H5>It sounds pretty weird--and it's not as "pure pomegranate" as I was hoping--but it does happen to be very, very good.  Serve hot as a meal to 6 people, with lots of bread on the side.</H5>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI>8 cups water
<LI>1 pound of <A HREF="fmeat.html">lamb shanks</A> or other lesser cuts of lamb and bone
<LI>1/2 cup yellow split <A HREF="fpeas.html">peas</A>
<LI>1 cup chopped <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>
<LI>3 <A HREF="fbeet.html">beets</A> with green tops
<LI>1/2 cup <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>
<LI>1 bunch of <A HREF="fgronion.html">scallions</A>, sliced well down into the green
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="fsugar.html">sugar</A>
<LI>3 Tablespoons <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lime juice</A>
<LI>1/2 cup <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="fpomegra.html">pomegranate concentrate</A> (called "molasses" or "paste"), or 1 cup <A HREF="fpomegra.html">pomegranate juice</A> (made by rolling an uncut fresh pomegranate hard underfoot on the floor, then making an incision and "squeezing" it over a juicer)
<LI>1/4 cup <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro</A>, chopped fine
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="fgreens.html">spinach</A>, chopped fine
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  A mixture of 1 Tablespoon dried<A HREF="fmint.html"> mint</A> (crumbled between your palms), 1/4 teaspoon <A HREF="fcinnamo.html">cinnamon</A>, and 1/4 teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A>
<P>
Bring the water to a boil in a large pot, then stir in the lamb, split peas, and onion.  Skim where necessary, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for an hour.
<P>
In the meantime, wash the beet tops and spinach, slice finely and chop, wrap in paper towels, and crisp until needed.  Also peel the beets and chop into a small dice.  Also prepare the mint/cinnamon/pepper garnish in a separate bowl.
<P>
When the lamb broth is ready, add the beets and rice and cook another 30 minutes.
<P>
Pick out the lamb--cut away the bones and fat, shred the meat, and return to the pot.  Add the scallions, 2 Tablespoons of sugar, 2 Tablespoons of lime juice, parsley, and either the pomegranate concentrate or the pomegranate juice.  Simmer for 10 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, bring the soup to a boil and stir in the beet greens and spinach.  Let wilt, while stirring for a minute or two, then stir in cilantro, more lime juice, as needed, and seasonings.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the mint/cinnamon/pepper topping.
