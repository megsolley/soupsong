<HR>
<H5>A favorite of sumo wrestlers, this particular Japanese soup is uncharacteristically stuffed with goodies--and just as uncharacteristically does not use fish-based <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi"><I>dashi</I></A> stock as the broth (since armless and legless fish are considered unlucky for wrestlers who depend so much on arms and legs). 
<P>
Friend Louise Elsea, who has specialized in Japanese cuisine, has graciously written the following gloss on sumo customs for me:  "In a sumo training stable, the wrestlers both live and train there.  The younger student apprentices in addition to training and practice, clean and cook, and act as attendants to the older wrestlers.  One of their duties is to prepare the soup.  The wrestlers eat in order of seniority, older wrestlers first, younger ones sharing the leftovers.  After all, the older ones once were in junior position, and the more junior hope to move forward.  So the wrestlers tend to develop a hand for cooking.  Those who wash out of training sometimes wind up opening  chankonabe-ya, or chankonabe restaurants."  Louise adds, "the Tokyo sumo stadium is in the Ryogoku district in Eastern Tokyo.  The various sumo stables until recently concentrated in that area, along with the businesses that supported them--clothing worn by rikishi (wrestlers) would fit very few Japanese outside the sumo world, and vice versa.  It is also in this area that chankonabe-ya are most often found."
<P>
Serve this soup as a meal to 4 people with big appetites.  Oh--and why chicken instead of beef?  Because cows keep all four feet on the ground...the very image of defeat for a wrestler down on all fours.
