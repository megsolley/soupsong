<H5>Wintry, yes; but subtly so.  Here the aromatics of <I>dashi</I> are given weight with a small slab of fish, a flower of carrot, and daikon sticks.  A bracing and stimulating prelude to a meal.  Serve hot to 4 people in beautiful cups.</H5>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">dashi</A>
<LI>1/2 small <A HREF="fcarrot.html">carrot</A>, notched lengthwise with a lemon zester so that thin slices look like flower petals
<LI>1/4 cup matchsticks of <A HREF="fdaikon.html">daikon</A> radish
<LI>4 slices of <A HREF="ffish.html">sea bass or other firm fish</A>, cut into exact 1-inch by 1-inch squares
<LI>8 tiny slivers of lemon rind (white scraped away)
</UL>  
<P>
Put salted water on the boil to cook the vegetables:  first, the carrot flowers until just tender; then the daikon; finally the fish boxes.  Drain each by turn.
<P>
When ready to serve, heat the dashi to a boil.  Set out thew heated bowls and arrange the fish, carrot flowers, and daikon strips in them.  With a large ladle, carefully pour the dashi into each bowl and top with a few strips of lemon rind.  Serve immediately.
