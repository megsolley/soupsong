<HR>
<H5>A Spanish "pureed salad" that even the fussiest eaters like.  I learned it as a "Malagan" gazpacho, but discovered from Seville native Jos&#233; Luis Vivas that it's much closer to a traditional Andalusian.  AND it is ridiculously easy and fast to make.  This is the one I'm most likely to make and drink straight out of the blender, reminding me of the remark of Nancy Woodworth of West Hartford, Connecticut: "I was intrigued to find, when we were in northern Spain last year, that one can buy gazpacho in the supermarkets in cartons like orange juice comes in -- it was delicious!"
Serve cold as a first course to 4 people.</H5>

<H5>Soup Tale:
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the 1970s Alexis Bespaloff, wine expert, shed light on the slow start this tangy Spanish
marvel had in the United States.  "Some years ago I dined in an elaborately decorated and expensive restaurant in Atlanta.  I was so surprised to see <I>gazpacho</I> on the menu that I ordered it, and this cold soup was beautifully served in a silver tureen, accompanied by minced onions and croutons.  As I began to eat the soup, I had the most peculiar impression about its taste, which was later confirmed by a friendly waiter:  I was sitting a long way from home, eating canned tomato juice out of a bowl with a spoon."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>1 2-lb. can of <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A> (or 8 large fresh tomatoes, peeled)
<LI>1 <A HREF="fcucumbe.html">cucumber</A>, peeled and chopped
<LI>1 <A HREF="fpepper.html">green pepper</A>, cored and chopped
<LI>1 clove <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>
<LI>1-2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>2-4 Tablespoons <A HREF="bflavor.html#vinegar">vinegar</A> (whatever you're in the mood for, but use white with fresh tomatoes so you don't overpower their fresh taste)
</UL>

Use the blender:  first chop up the garlic, then add the cucumbers and green peppers, adding tomato juice as needed to liquify.  Finally add the tomatoes and the rest of the juice.  If you want elegance, press through a sieve.  If you're going for heartiness, just leave it the way it is.  Mix in the olive oil, vinegar, and salt.  Refrigerate.
<P>
When ready to serve, pour into bowls and garnish with salad vegetables as you see fit:  minced or notched and sliced <A HREF="fcucumbe.html">cucumber</A>; thin <A HREF="fpepper.html">green pepper</A> slices; chopped <A HREF="fgronion.html">green onions</A>; and/or croutons.
