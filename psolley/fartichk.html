The tender-<BR>
hearted artichoke<BR>
dressed in its armor,<BR>
build its modest cupola<BR>
and stood<BR>
erect,<BR>
impenetrable<BR>
beneath<BR>
a lamina of leaves.<BR>
Around it,<BR>
maddened vegetables,<BR>
ruffling their leaves,<BR>
contrived<BR>
creepers, cattails,<BR>
bulbs and tubers to astound;<BR>
beneath the ground <BR>
slept<BR>
the red-whiskered carrot;<BR>
above, the grapevine<BR>
dried its runners,<BR>
bearers of the wine;<BR>
the cabbage<BR>
preened itself,<BR>
arranging its flounces;<BR>
oregano<BR>
perfumed the world,<BR>
while the gentle<BR>
artichoke<BR>
stood proudly in the garden,<BR>
clad in armor<BR>
burnished<BR>
to a pomegranate<BR>
glow.<BR>
And then one day,<BR>
with all the other artichokes<BR>
in willow baskets,<BR>
our artichoke<BR>
set out to market<BR>
to realize its dream;<BR>
life as a soldier.<BR>
Amid the ranks<BR>
never was it so martial<BR>
as in the fair,<BR>
white-shirted<BR>
men<BR>
among the greens<BR>
marshaled<BR>
the field<BR>
of artichokes;<BR>
close formations,<BR>
shouted commands,<BR>
and the detonation<BR>
of a falling crate.<BR>
But<BR>
look,<BR>
here comes<BR>
Maria<BR>
with her shopping basket.<BR>
Unintimidated,<BR>
she selects<BR>
our artichoke,<BR>
examines it, holds it to<BR>
the light as if it were an egg;<BR>
she buys it,<BR>
she drops it<BR>
in a shopping bag<BR>
that holds a pair of shoes,<BR>
a cabbage head, and one<BR>
bottle<BR>
of vinegar.<BR>
Once home<BR>
and in the kitchen<BR>
she drowns it in a pot.<BR>
And thus ends<BR>
in peace<BR>
the saga<BR>
of the armored vegetable<BR>
we call the artichoke,<BR>
as<BR>
leaf by leaf<BR>
we unsheathe<BR>
its delights<BR>
and eat<BR>
the peaceable flesh<BR>
of its green heart.<BR>
--Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Artichoke," translated by M.S. Peden from "Oda a la Alcachofa"

<H4>(Cynara scolymus)</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
The name <I>artichoke</I> comes from the Arabic <I>al' quarshuf</I>.  The Latin name <I>cynara</I> has survived in the Italian artichoke liqueur <I>Cynar</I>, a fairly bitter and hair raising aperitif.

<P>The artichoke is a thistle, native to the Mediterranean region.  It probably began life as the thistle known as <I>cardoon</I> (still sold in Italy and in North African souqs), then it was cultivated by Romans, not only for their stalks (<I>cardui</I>), but also for their flower receptacles (<I>sponduli</I>)...which grew into today's handsome globes.
<P>
Hesiod first mentions the plant, but it was Pliny who complained about its high price--"we even turn the monstrosities of the earth to the purposes of gluttony"-- and ironically commented on the fact that thistles, of all things, would be forbidden to the lower classes. It was eaten with pleasure by both ancient Greeks and Romans.   
<P>
When Catherine de Medici left Florence in the 16th century to become Henry II's Queen of France, she took her own cooks--and artichokes--with her, thus beginning the style of cooking that became known as French <I>haute cuisine.</I>  Word has it that artichoke heart fritters were one of her great weaknesses....  To this day, the fields of France--and Brittany in particular--are resplendent with these odd looking plants that would feel at home on the pages of Dr. Seuss books.
<P>
The Dutch introduced artichokes to England--and they were growing in Henry VIII's garden at Newhall in 1530, perhaps because of their reputation as an aphrodisiac.

<P>Artichokes were first introduced to America by French colonists who settled in Louisiana in the early 1700s--but they didn't catch on.  Then Thomas Jefferson brought artichokes back to Monticello from Italy--but they still didn't catch on.  Only at the beginning of the 20th century, when Italian immigrants settled around Half Moon Bay on the California coast and planted a few hundred acres, did artichokes come into their own as a commercial success.
<P>
Only recently have scientists been able to discover why food tastes sweet after eating an artichoke:  two elements in its chemical make up are not water soluble; these alter the taste buds of the tongue so that nonsweet substances appear to have been sweetened.  Thus they are being considered as a possible alternative to sugar.
<P>
Watch out for baby artichokes in the spring.  These egg-size beauties are so tender, they can be eaten whole when well cooked.
