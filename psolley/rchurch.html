<H5>Ritchie Wallace, in Maine, sent this recipe in--an Italianate beef-vegetable soup, credited to Bonnie Vawter (a pastor's wife) in Missouri, that she found years ago in a magazine.  It's rich and substantial, perfect for an evening meal or a pot luck.  Ritchie--who lives in the woods of Maine with husband Tim, their great dane Gisburn, and two cats, Hillery and Tawanda--testifies that it helps "stave off the winter cold"...which got down to 19 below about the time she wrote.  Serve hot to 12 people.</H5>
