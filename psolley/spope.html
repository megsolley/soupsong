<BLOCKQUOTE>Take a knuckle of <A HREF="fmeat.html">Veal</A><BR>
(You may buy it, or steal),<BR>
In a few peices cut it,<BR>
In a Stewing pan put it,<BR>
<A HREF="fsalt.html">Salt</A>, <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A> and <A HREF="fmace.html">mace</A><BR>
Must season this knuckle,<BR>
Then what's join'd to a place,<BR>
With other Herbs muckle;<BR>
That which killed King Will,<BR>
And what never stands still,<BR>
Some sprigs of that bed<BR>
Where Children are bred,<BR>
Which much you will mend, if<BR>
Both <A HREF="fgreens.html">Spinage</A> and <A HREF="fgreens.html">Endive</A>,<BR>
And <A HREF="fgreens.html">Lettuce</A> and <A HREF="fbeet.html">Beet</A>,<BR>
With Marygold meet;<BR>
Put no water at all;<BR>
For it maketh things small;<BR>
Which, lest it should happen,<BR>
A close cover clap on;<BR>
Put this pot of Wood's mettle<BR>
In a hot boiling kettle,<BR>
And there let it be,<BR>
(Mark the Doctrine I teach)<BR>
About------------let me see,-------------<BR>
Thrice as long as you preach.<BR>
So skimming the fat off,<BR>
Say Grace, with your hat off<BR>
O then, with what rapture<BR>
Will it fill Dean and Chapter!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BR><H5>Note:  "what's join'd to a place" is <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery</A>; King William III was killed when his horse, <A HREF="fgreens.html">Sorrell</A>, stumbled; <A HREF="fthyme.html">thyme</A>, of course, "never stands still"; and the meaning of "bed where children are bred" is <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>, but I don't know why. </H5>
