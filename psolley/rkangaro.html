<H5>Non-marsupial nations, do not despair.  David Bruguera-McLaren, chef de cuisine at The Melbourne Soup Kitchen  in Australia, says we can substitute oxtails--and as far as I'm concerned, he's right.  Oxtails are wonderful in this rich, deeply flavored and deeply satisfying cold-weather soup.  Serve hot as a meal to 8-10 people, with crusty bread, salad, and red wine, while the cold wind beats against the door.  </H5>

Roll into 1-inch balls.  Drop in gently boiling salted water and cook for about 10 minutes.  Drain and hold until ready to serve.)
<P>
Brown the meat in a 450-degree oven, turning over once.<P>
Meanwhile, in a large stockpot, saute the onion, carrrot, celery, and garlic in the oil.  Deglaze the pot with the port, add red wine and bring to a boil.  Add the tomato paste and the parsley roots (or parsnip) tied together with the thyme.  Reduce to a simmer and cook down to half.
<P>
Add the browned kangeroo tail (or oxtails) and coat thoroughly.  Add the stock, tomato puree, salt, and pepper--bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 90 minutes.  Strain completely, reserving the meat to add to the soup later, and refrigerate until you can scoop all the fat off the top easily and discard.
<P>
When getting ready to serve, prepare and cook the dumplings.  Then discard the congealed fat on top of the soup, bring the soup to a boil, and add the meat to it (discarding the bones).
<P>
Ladle into bowls and spoon the dumplings into each.  Serve out back with crusty bread, a big salad, and lots of red wine.
