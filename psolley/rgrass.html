<HR>
<H5>This totally nutritious and deeply green soup was a contribution of Gordon Lennox, as deft in the kitchen as he is entertaining grandchildren.  The soup is so clean tasting, I could drink a gallon of it at a sitting--and feel like I could leap tall buildings at a single bound afterward.  Mr. Lennox is a native of Catherington, UK.  He's served this to his grandchildren after cutting the grass...and led them to believe there was a connection.  "You're only teasing, Granpa!" they say--and wolf it down.  It's delicious.  Serve hot to 4 people.</H5>

Microwave the chicken or chicken parts for 20 minutes.  Let cool briefly, then cut off the chicken meat, reserving it for another dish.  Plunge the bones, remnants, and jelly into a saucepan with the 6 cups of water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and cook for 20 minutes.  Strain, and return broth to the saucepan.
<P>
Bring the stock to a boil, then add leeks, celery, potato, parsley, and any other green veggies you might have on hand.  Boil on medium-low heat for about 30 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, puree, season to taste, and ladle into bowls.  Mr. Lennox says it "goes down like a bomb!"
