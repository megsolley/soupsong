<U>King Henry V, I, 1</U>:<BR>
ELY:     The <A HREF="fberry.html">strawberry</A> grows underneath the <A HREF="fgreens.html">nettle</A>
        And wholesome <A HREF="fberry.html">berries</A> thrive and ripen best
        Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
        And so the prince obscured his contemplation
        Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
        Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
        Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

<HR>
<U>King Henry V, III, 7</U>:<BR>
ORLEANS:   He's of the colour of the <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmeg</A>.
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 2</U>:<BR>
DUMAIN:    A gilt <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmeg</A>.

<U>The Comedy of Errors, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:      Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
        A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
        A <A HREF="fnuts.html">nut</A>, a cherry-stone;
        But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
        Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
        The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
<P>
<U>As You Like It, III, 2</U>:<BR>
TOUCHSTONE:   Sweetest <A HREF="fnuts.html">nut</A> hath sourest rind,
        Such a <A HREF="fnuts.html">nut</A> is Rosalind.
        He that sweetest rose will find
        Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
        This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
        infect yourself with them?
<P>
CELIA:   Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
        horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
        think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
        <A HREF="fnuts.html">worm-eaten nut</A>. (III, 4)
<P>
<U>Troilus and Cressida, II, 1</U>:<BR>
THERSITES:       E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
        sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
        catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
        were as good crack <A HREF="fnuts.html">a fusty nut with no kernel</A>.
<P>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, II, 5</U>:<BR>
LAFEU:   And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
        prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
        of me, there can be <A HREF="fnuts.html">no kernel in this light nut</A>; the
        soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
        matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
        tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
        I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
        deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.
<P>
<U>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, II, 2</U>:<BR>
HAMLET:    O God, I could be bounded in a <A HREF="fnuts.html">nut shell</A> and count
        myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
        have bad dreams.
<P>
<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
TITANIA:   I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
        The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new <A HREF="fnuts.html">nuts</A>.
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, III, 1</U>:<BR>
MERCUTIO:        Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
        shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
        thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
        or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
        wilt quarrel with a man for cracking <A HREF="fnuts.html">nuts</A>, having no
        other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
        eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
        Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> is full of
        meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
        an <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A> for quarrelling
