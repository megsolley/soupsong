<H5><I>Baba Ghannouj</I> translates literally to "spoiled old daddy." Why?  Because, the story goes, the woman who created it pureed the eggplant just to ease the eating and digestion of her old and toothless father. A nice story--and a substantial and aromatic start to a Mideast meal; serve hot to 4-6 people; imagine yourself in a Turkish souq.</H5>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>1 large <A HREF="feggplan.html">eggplant</A>
<LI>1/4 cup tahini (ground raw sesame seeds, found in most supermarkets)
<LI>2 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>
<LI>1 and 1/2 teaspoons <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>6 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable</A> or <A HREF="bstock.html#beef stock">beef stock</A>
<LI>1 <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lemon</A>, juiced
<LI>1 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>
<LI>1/3 cup finely chopped <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>
</UL>
Heat the eggplant in a 350 degree oven for 15-20 minutes.  Cool, then--holding it by the stem--carefully peel the skin away and remove the stem.  Puree with the tahini, garlic, and salt.  Stir into the heated stock, then bring to a simmer.  Partially cover, then simmer for 30 minutes.  Remove from heat and press through a sieve, discarding solids.
<P>
When ready to serve, heat the soup, then beat the egg with the lemon juice and stir through the simmering soup to form long egg strands.  Simmer for another couple minutes (2-3), then ladle into bowls and top with handfuls of fresh chopped parsley.  Top with toasted strips of pita bread.  Serve with warm triangles of pita bread on the side.
