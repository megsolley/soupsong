<H5>This <A HREF="svietnam.html">Vietnamese</A> soup is really lovely to look at--I recommend serving in flat soup bowls for the full effect.  In taste, the broth is earthy and sour, with an sea-salt tang, all counterpointed by the sweetness of the shrimp and the peppery crunch of the watercress.  In a word, it's an elegant appetite stimulant.  Serve hot to 4 people as a first course.  </H5>

<UL>
<LI>1 <A HREF="fshallot.html">shallot</A>
<LI>3 Tablespoons <A HREF="ffish.html">nuoc mam</A> (fish sauce)
<LI>&#188; teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A>
<LI>&#188; pound large <A HREF="fshrimp.html">shrimp</A> (about 12), peeled and deveined, shells reserved for the broth
<LI>6 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock vietnam">Vietnamese chicken stock</A> (or regular <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A> simmered with a 1-inch piece of smashed <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger root</A>)
<LI>1&#189; bunches <A HREF="fwatercr.html">watercress</A>, chopped into manageable pieces for eating (it's traditional to leave whole, but what a mess!)
</UL>
 Pound the shallot into a paste, then mix in the nuoc mam and the pepper.  Toss in the shrimp and pound the paste into them--they should stay whole.
<P>
Heat the stock in a large saucepan to a boil, then stir in the reserved shrimp shells, reduce to medium heat, and cook for about 8 minutes.  Fish out the shells with a strainer spoon.
<P>
When ready to serve, reheat the stock to a boil.  Add the shrimp and cook for 1 minute.  Toss in the watercress, and cook for another minute.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately.
