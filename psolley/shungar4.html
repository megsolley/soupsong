<HR>
Once upon a time there was a boy who lived with his father.  He also had a stepmother and she was a most spiteful woman who annoyed and scolded young Peter all the livelong day.  Every time he was out of doors she called him in; whenever he was indoors, she sent him out, and all the time she cursed him with bell, book, and candle.  She begrudged him the very food and drink he ate and drank.  
<P>
Peter was, therefore, very surprised on day when his stepmother actually sent a plate of potato soup in front of him.  But as he was very hungry she sat down straight away and took up his spoon.  As he opened his mouth for the first spoonful of soup he saw, out of the corner of his eye, a branch of the briar bush poking its way through the window towards him!  The bush had been planted outside the window by his own dear mother and when the branch began to speak, Peter's mouth remained open in astonishment.
<P>
"My dearest boy," said the branch, "do not eat your soup.  It is poisoned!  Leave the house, and for your own safety, go away!"
<P>
Peter closed his mouth and dropped his spoon.  He got up and, without saying a word, left the house for ever.

<H5><I>The story continues.  Briar Peter wins the Princess against all odds.  And briar bushes figure largely in the plot and in the resolution.  All of which can be read in the full account (Hungarian Folk-tales, Oxford University Press, 1980).  
<P>
Two things, however, are interesting here.  First, the tale is dated by the soup--potatoes didn't arrive in Hungary until the late 18th century.  Second, notwithstanding its ultimate popularity, Hungarians were as suspicious as the rest of Europe about this member of the deadly nightshade family--it simply had the odor of poison about it.  By the 19th century, though, it was being grown everywhere and had become not only food, but gloves for the poor:  children would be given a hot baked potato to put in their pockets and take to school--first a handwarmer, then lunch.</I>
