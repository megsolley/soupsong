<P>
<H5><U>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, IV, 5</U>:<BR>
OPHELIA:   There's <A HREF="ffennel.html">fennel</A> for you, and columbines: there's rue
        for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
        herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
        a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
        some violets, but they withered all when my father
        died: they say he made a good end,--[Sings] For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

<U>King Henry VI, II, 3</U>:<BR>
HORNER:  Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and
        a <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A> for Peter!
<P>
<U>King John, II, 1</U>:<BR>
CONSTANCE:      Do, child, go to it grandam, child:
        Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
        Give it a <A HREF="fplum.html">plum</A>, a <A HREF="fcherry.html">cherry</A>, and a <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A>:
        There's a good grandam.
<P>
<U>King Henry IV, part 2, V, 3</U>:<BR>
PISTOL:    A foutre for thine office!
        Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;
        Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:
        When Pistol lies, do this; and <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A> me, like
        The bragging Spaniard.
<P>
<U>King Henry V, III, 6</U>:<BR>
PISTOL:  The <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A> of Spain!
<P>
<U>Othello, The Moor of Venice, I, 3</U>:<BR>
IAGO:    Virtue! a <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A>! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
        or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
        our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
        nettles, or sow <A HREF="fgreens.html">lettuce</A>, set <A HREF="fhyssop.html">hyssop</A> and weed up
       <A HREF="fthyme.html"> thyme</A>, supply it with one gender of <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">herbs</A>, or
        distract it with many, either to have it sterile
        with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
        power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
        wills. 
<P>
<U>Anthony and Cleopatra, V, 2</U>:<BR>
FIRST GUARD:    This is an aspic's trail: and these <A HREF="ffig.html">fig-leaves</A>
        Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
        Upon the caves of Nile.
