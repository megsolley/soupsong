<H5>This soup was created by Ronnie Reed in Worthington, Ohio, and his story is as good as his recipe--an inspiration to lovers everywhere. If you're trying to survive a difficult time...aren't used to cooking...wouldn't mind losing a little weight...are yearning to be with the one you love--if all of these things, I think you'll be interested in what Ronnie has to say about soup and love.</H5>
<HR>
I'm 31 years of age and work for a international business machine company.
My wife and I have been married together for 12 years. I have
grown to love and appreciate soups in general lately. During my marriage
separation, I ate soups for lunch and dinner for, well let's just say, A LONG
TIME! I went from 220 down to 190 in a matter of months. I still eat soups
at least twice a week. In a nutshell, it's good for you and good for the
soul. SOUPS RULE!!
<P>
Here's my story and recipe......
<P>
                              <CENTER>The Starving Artist Soup</CENTER>
<P>
 This soup was invented during a time when my wife and I were
 separated for a few months. In an attempt to lose weight, cut back on costs,
 but not die from starvation, I had to learn how to cook since man cannot
 live off of beer and peanut butter crackers alone. To me, if it's worth
 looking at, it's worth eating. So in attempt to be as creative as I could
 without burning down the kitchen, I made 'The Starving Artist Soup'. It's
 easy, quick, and it looks good too. What you will need are...
<UL>
 <LI>2 Cans of Campbells Beef & Veggie Soup
<LI>1 Pound of Hamburger (Sirloin)
</UL>
          <CENTER> (It's half way done!)</CENTER>
<P>
    Directions: Brown the hamburger in a pot, drain the grease (optional,
 depends on how hungry you are).  Drop the two cans on the hamburger, add two
 cans of water. Let it cook for 2 minutes on HIGH! Bring boil down to
simmer.<P>
 It makes about four bowls so you can eat 2 that night and have left overs
 the next night for dinner. It does taste better the second day, not sure
why?

 I lived on this stuff for 4 months and lost 20 pounds, paid my expenses,
 and survived. My wife, after discovering that I did not die without her,
 came back. :) That's my story and recipe. Thanks for reading it.
