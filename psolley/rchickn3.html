<H5>Really doesn't sound like it's going to work at all--but, oh, is it good.  Thanks for the recipe, sister Dine.  Serve hot as a meal to 4-6 friends or 3 Volga boatmen.</H5>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H5>SoupTale:  This national soup, touted for being a surefire cure for hangovers, graced 18th century aristocratic tables in a variation that included the highest quality caviar.  The truly key ingredient, however, is <I>rassol</I> or "pickle juice"--a true staple of Russian cuisine.  Because pickles vary from household to household, variations of Rassolnik are legion (pitersky, moskovsky, troitsky, etc.) and have even come to include the exotica of watermelons, pears, or cherries.</H5></BLOCKQUOTE>
