<H3>History:</H3>
Most stories about the origin of pasta center around who introduced it to Italy.  Some say Marco Polo, citing accounts which claimed he learned the art in China in the late 13th century and brought it back to Venice. Others say it arrived with rampaging Germanic tribes in the 5th century, sweet-talked out of a chieftain's kitchen maid by an amorous Roman soldier.
<P>
Certainly Italy has turned pasta into an art form, but this created food is native to many different cuisines, from China, Japan, and Southeast Asia to Central Europe--and certainly began elsewhere.  The Chinese had it by the first century AD--and noodle shops were all the rage by the Sung dynasty (960-1280)...yet one early Chinese writer indicates that common people learned to make noodles from foreigners, which he didn't say.  Japan was making pasta squares, then switched to ribbon shapes in the 12th century (see below).  Then, too, people in India and the Middle East were making them by 1200.
<P>
At any rate, pasta didn't become big business and world famous until the 18th century, at which time entrepreneurs in Naples, Italy, began mass production by machine--to the point that homemade pasta was in a steep decline by the 19th century, particularly in southern Italy. 
<P>
These hard little unleavened breads, cooked in boiling water, can be made from any number of different flours, starches, and beans.
