<HR>
<H5>Stan Laskos from Diamond, Ohio, sent this recipe in--and it's a honey, especially for those of us with fond childhood memories of grandmothers bubbling up sauerkraut on the stove.  Stan tells the story of his Polish grandmother who "in the winter, once in a great while, would make the sauerkraut soup, and never that I remember for large family gatherings.  She would call up...we lived about 1/10 mile away...and I would have the 'fun' job of walking to her house on the snowy country road to carry back a quart of that sauerkraut soup for my parents.  I was probably 9-10 years old about then.  I could not stand that sauerkraut soup."  But times and tastes change.  Some 20 years ago, Stan noticed a soup recipe on the back of a package of sauerkraut--and ultimately adapted it to the one here, which he will make for his family (his kids love it...even ask for it) on a cold winter day. ..."but not too often"!  Serve hot as a meal to 6 people.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>2 pounds <A HREF="fcabbage.html">sauerkraut</A>, drained
<LI>1-2 pounds <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork ribs</A>
<LI>1 quart <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A>, cut up with juice (a large 28-ounce can is fine)
<LI>1 medium <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, sliced
<LI>1-3 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, minced
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="fsugar.html">sugar</A> (optional)
<LI>water, to your preferred thick/thin consistency (about 8 cups)
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt </A>and <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A> to taste
<LI><A HREF="fpaprika.html">paprika</A> to taste
</UL>  
<P>
Combine all ingredients in a large pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer 2-3 hours, until the meat readily falls off the bones.
<P>
Pick out the bones, correct seasoning, and serve.  This is excellent with homemade bread.  It is also really good with boiled potatoes on the side.
