<CENTER><H2><I>Soup Goes to the Movies</I></H2><H5>It was Jackie Mason who said "You know how movies always have sex scenes and the studios say that is because sex is part of life and movies should be lifelike?  So why don't movies have more soup scenes? Soup is part of life; no one was ever too tired to have soup." <BR> Well guess what?  Soup is everywhere in the movies, from Spartacus igniting the slave rebellion by drowning the Centurion master in a pot of bean soup...to Inspector Oxford, in Hitchcock's <I>Frenzy</I>, actively dismayed by his wife's soupe de poisson. ...Ya gotta know NOW:  In what oldie-but-goodie does a streetwise punk bond with naive cowboy Joe Buck over a mug of soup?

       <TD>It was 1962.  Delta Tao Chi House of Faber College had selected its pledges.  Dean Wormer (John Vernon) was not happy with Delta activities--and placed it on the dreaded double-secret probation.  That was just about the time that Flounder (Steve Furst) ran afoul of Neidermeyer (Mark Metcalf), his commanding officer at ROTC, for wearing his Delta pledge pin on his uniform.  Enter Boon (Peter Riegert) and Otter (Tim Matheson), who retaliated by hitting golf balls at Neidermeyer.  Oops.  What a hook:  lands right in the soup kettle in the school cafeteria kitchen. ...Much later, we find John 'Bluto' Blutarksy (John Belushi) cruising the garbage trays in that same cafeteria.  Hey, there's a bowl of soup (watery beef onion?) with a golf ball in it.  Mmmmmmmm.  He picks out the golf ball and eats it in 3 bites.

The movie opens with Martina and Filippa, Danish puritan sisters, taking the poor and sick villagers bowls of good soup.  Only later do we find out why that soup is so good:  it's been prepared by one of the great chefs of the world, transplanted to Jutland after a brutal French uprising in 1871.  When this chef unexpectedly wins the lottery, years later, she spends every sou creating a 5-star meal in honor of Martina and Filippa's deceased pastor father, including this turtle soup.  Happily, a famous Danish general is present at the meal who has the discrimination to say:

guys in the fight.  It's all heart, seeing soup being ladled into bowls and guys sitting at a table slurping it while Bugsy (lip-syncing a song) tries to convince them to help him
smash Dandy Dan.  This classic is a fave of Steve McMullen, who saw it in the theater with his girlfriend, soon to become his wife.

       <TD>In this shattered memoir of 1936 Spain on the brink of civil war, soup operates as a symbol of family tranquillity:  first, boiling over on the stove when Moncho (Manuel Lozano) argues with his mother (Uxia Blanco) over the existence of God and the devil; second, served from a tureen as a sacrament of family life--the traditional Galician soup with pork and lots of cabbage; and third, offered to Don Gregorio (Fernando Fern&#225;n G&#243;mez) as a restorative after he wades into a river with Moncho to save him from a dangerous asthma attack.  Not that such friendship saves the good professor from being carted off at the end to be shot as a Red.

Restrained in a chair, the King is fed a spoonful of beef broth by Willis, which he quite deliberately blows out in Willis' face.  But the next spoonful?  The King swallows, knowing and hating his submission.  "I'm here.  But I'm not all there," he says.  Next scene he is shown eating his own broth with a spoon.

        <TD><B>The Soup Song (1933)</B>,<BR>Animator, Ub Iwerks</TD>
       <TD>The legendary animation pioneer (and creator of Mickey Mouse) Ub Iwerks left Walt Disney in 1930 and struck out on his own with Flip the Frog.  In this adorable short, Flip is head waiter in a cafe, orchestrating the orchestral entertainment, the seating and service, and cooking up the soup in the kitchen.  He gets sidetracked by a flirtatious kitten, but ultimately serves the soup to a big tuxedoed dog--first throwing a life preserver to the fly swimming in the soup (see <A HREF="sjokes.html">Soup Jokes</A>), then conducting a symphony of the dog's soup sipping to the tune of <I>Auld Lang Syne</I>.

       <TD>Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) falls in love with Varinia (Jean Simmons) over soup she's doling out at the Gladiator Slave School in Capua.  When she is sold off to decadent Roman aristocrats, he is goaded by Marcellus, the cruel gladiator trainer--and he reacts by lashing out, drowning Marcellus in a very large kettle of bean soup, thus igniting the rebellion of the gladiator slaves against Rome and Roman rule. In the filming of the scene, "Marcellus" actually broke his jaw when his face was shoved into the pot, but he was a good sport and let the scene finish before asking to go to the hospital.

Carroll) is kicked out for having a breakdown after 20 years on the job, Drs. Peterson (Ingrid Bergman), Fleurot (John Emory), Graff (Steven Geray), and Hanish (Paul Harvey) join him for soup at dinner, daintily spooning sip after sip, awaiting the arrival of his replacement, the mysterious Dr.Edwards/John Ballantine (Gregory Peck).

Macy), Stars Bob Berrenger (Alec Baldwin) and Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) misplace the dinner invitation and forget to show up at the Mayor's (Charles Durning).  The Mayor waits...and waits...and waits.  When one hungry guest finally picks up the soup spoon, the Mayor's wife (Patti LuPone, <I>completely</I> over the top) hisses fortissimo, "DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT!"  And what was that elegant soup in flat white soup bowls?  Looked like lobster bisque to me.

       <TD>Four soups served in 4 key scenes--all from beautiful tureens at Jewish family dinners in Budapest, largely before the fall of Emperor Franz Josef's multicultural liberal stable regime.  In the happy days, papa Emmanuel Sonnenschein (David De Keyser) complains, "There's too much salt in this soup!"  To which Valeria (Jennifer Ehle) replies, "The cook must be in love."  That's before her love for brother/cousin Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered.  Next:  Valeria is preggers and Ignatz announces his intention to marry her, right before the soup is served.  Mama (Miriam Margolyes) faints, falls on the floor, and "Sunshine," the famous family herbal tonic, is administered.  Third:  Wedding soup, with dumplings.  And last, Ignatz--ignominious after the death of Franz Josef and the rise of the communists, under arrest and a shadow of himself--is served soup in the same bowl, from the same tureen, as had been his papa.  "There is no salt in this soup," he weeps.  And mama and estranged wife fight over the salt shaker, a contest that hinges on whether his taste or his blood pressure will be served. The dinners, the bowls, the tureens, the religion--all are swept away henceforth.

       <TD>A superb contribution, sent in by pal Ray Connolly in these words:  "The story deals with a pastor in the Swiss Alps summoned to a dilapidated cabin where an old woman has died. He learns that she has a blind daughter who is running wild in animal-like conditions (&#224; la Truffaut's WILD CHILD). He and a neighbor woman make a pot of soup (type not identified) and the pastor takes a dish of it to an open doorway and starts hitting the dish with a spoon. ("Soup, soup, wonderful soup!" No, that was my imagination.) Yes, sure enough, this wild girl comes a-runnin from the woods and gets down on her knees to slurp up the soup like a dog or cat would. The slurping sounds are real loud. You'll love this scene!"  Many thanks, Raymundo!

       <TD>The famous, sex-drenched eating scene between Tom (Albert Finney) and, (all unknowingly) possibly his mother Mrs. Waters (Joyce Redman) begins naturally enough with big steaming pewter bowls of soup, whereat Mrs. Waters leans well over the table and lustily slurps big round spoonsful, breasts tumbling out of her bodice, with a more-than-come-hither look.  Tom, nearly overcome,  involuntarily rips a claw off the langouste he has in his hand and sucks happily on it. Drafts of ale, turkey, oysters, pears, and wine are then dispatched with loving attention.

Daughter Letitia (Elizabeth Pe&#241;a) brings home for dinner the man she's just eloped with:<H6>Orlando (Paul Rodriguez):  "I love toppings.  I've always loved toppings.  Sometimes I go to restaurants and I just ask for toppings.  You know, I say, the more toppings the merrier.
