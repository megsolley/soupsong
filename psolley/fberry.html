<H3>Strawberries (<I>Frangaria</I>):</H3>
This member of the rose family is not a true berry at all, since it carries its tiny seeds on the outside of its flesh, not within its tissue.  Its name probably derives from the way it grows--originally called <I>strewberry</I> because of the way it's "strewn" over the ground. 
<P>
Romans were known to relish wild strawberries.  Then, in the 1700s, a hybrid was developed between <I>Frangaria chiloensis</I>, the Chilean pine, and <I>Frangaria virginiana </I>(the Scarlet Virginian) that essentially became the modern strawberry.   Of the latter, which was mentioned first in Massachusetts in 1621, one colonist in Maryland wrote,  "We cannot set down a foot but we tread on strawberries." 
<P>
Alpine strawberries (<I>Frangaria vesca semperflorens)</I>, by contrast, grow in clumps and were native to Europe north of the Alps.  They were unknown to ancient Greeks; barely mentioned by Romans and early medieval writers; but were greatly popular in England ifrom the 13th century onward.

<H3>Blueberries (Vaccinium myrtillus): </H3>
Although considered a traditional American and Canadian fruit (and these two countries supply 95% of the world supply), blueberries (aka, huckleberries or whortleberries) are native to Europe and found on heaths and moors in acid soils.
