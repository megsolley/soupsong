<H5>The 3rd Book of the <I>Problemata</I>--a work traditionally ascribed to Aristotle--is entirely devoted to the human reaction to alcohol.
<BLOCKQUOTE>Why is it that to those who are very drunk, everything seems to revolve in a circle?...
<BR>Why is it that to those who are drunk one thing at which they are looking sometimes appears to be many?...
<BR>Why is it that wine which is mixed but tends towards the unmixed causes a worse headache the next morning than entirely unmixed wine?...
<BR>Why is it that <A HREF="fcabbage.html">cabbage</A> stops the ill effects of drinking?...</BLOCKQUOTE>
Serve this substantial soup hot to 4-6 people.  Like French onion soup, it is surprisingly sweet and tender.  To really take care of that headfuzz, sleep late, then serve at brunch with a good beer and a crisp salad.

<UL>
<LI>1 head of <A HREF="fcabbage.html">cabbage</A>, shredded
<LI>1/4 cup <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>
<LI>2 Tablespoons brown sugar
<LI>1 and 1/2 quarts of <A HREF="bstock.html#beef stock">beef stock</A>
<LI>1 teaspoon <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>1/2 teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A>
<LI>1/8 teaspoon <A HREF="fallspic.html">allspice</A>
</UL>
<I>Optional garnishes:</I>  dumplings--or <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheddar cheese</A> and croutons.
<P>
In a Dutch oven, brown the cabbage on all sides in the butter, stirring often, until it is colored a light brown.  This will take at least 15 minutes, and it should be watched carefully at the end as the browning takes place quickly.
<P>
Add the sugar and stir until it is completely dissolved.  Add the stock, salt, pepper, and allspice--bring to a boil, then simmer, covered, for about an hour.  Traditionally, it is served with dumplings, but it is delicious with toasted croutons and a handful of cheddar cheese thrown in.  Don't forget how good it is with a good and cold beer and a sharp salad.
