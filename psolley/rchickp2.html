<LI>2 1-lb. tins of <A HREF="fbeans.html#chickpeas">chickpeas</A> (also sold as garbanzos)
<LI>4-6 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, peeled
<LI>1/3 cup <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>1 and 1/2 teaspoons<A HREF="frosemar.html"> rosemary</A>, crushed to a powder
<LI>2/3 cup canned <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A>, with their juice, cut up coarsely

In a large saucepan, saute the garlic cloves in oil until they are well browned, then discard (or eat).  Stir in the powdered rosemary, then the tomatoes and their juice.  Cook down over medium heat until the tomatoes separate from their juice, about 20 minutes.  Add the chickpeas with their liquid and cook for 5 minutes, stirring. Add the stock, bring to a boil, cover, and boil over medium heat for 15 minutes.  Add more stock as necessary to give the soup the consistency of cream.  Adjust for seasoning, boil another minute, and ladle into bowls.  Garnish with a sprinkling of <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>.  If it goes with the meal, you can splash a little <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">red wine</A> into each bowl.
