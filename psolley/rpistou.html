<HR>
<H5>Leave it to the French to create a perfectly pure and boring vegetable soup--then lift it to astonishing heights by the last minute addition of <A HREF="bflavor.html#pesto"><I>pistou</I></A>, an intense concentration of garlic, cheese, oil, and tomato paste that knocks those poor little naked veggies ecstatically flat.  This is a simplified version of the recipe my fishing buddy Susan Eggert gave me--I like it because it's so simple I don't put off making it...especially when I've got leftover frozen <I>pistou</I> in the freezer.  Serve hot as a meal to 6-8 people.  And don't forget the crusty bread and wine.  </H5>

Press the garlic, then whisk the tomato paste, basil, cheese, oil, and parsley with it in a blender til it is a rich paste.</H5></BLOCKQUOTE>

In a large soup pot, bring the soaked beans and fresh water to a boil.  Add all the vegetables and herbs, bring to a second boil, then reduce the heat, cover the pot, and simmer for an hour. Meanwhile, make the pistou if you don't have any handy in the freezer.
<P>
Add the salt and pepper to the soup, stir well, and continue simmering uncovered for another 15-20 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into big bowls.  Pass the pistou--and extra Parmesan cheese, if you like--so people can load up the bowl with flavor that releases itself right under their noses.
