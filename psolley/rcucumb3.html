<H5>And this is no joke.  The personal creation of Jeri Held--California publicist for motion pictures, amateur chef, and owner of Featuremedia (a San Diego-
based PR/publicity firm that handles start ups, blue chips, and e-commerce)--this cold cucumber soup takes the classic Tarator to a new and deliciously subtle level.  It's cool, light but satisfying, and is one of those soups that you can just live on.  Jeri says the recipe grew from a desire to eat healthy and use up a 
bushel of cukes someone gave her.  This is one you definitely want to have on hand in the fridge at all times.  Serve cold to 6 as a first course...or, selfishly, just eat the whole thing yourself.</H5>

Blend all ingredients in a blender in small batches, then whisk together, retaste for seasoning, and refrigerate for a couple hours.  When ready to serve, whisk briefly, ladle into bowls, top each with a dollop of sour cream and a mint sprig.  In Jeri's words, "ecstasy!"
