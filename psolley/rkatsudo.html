<H5>It's stretching this a bit to include as a soup, but after reading the climactic scene about Katsudon in <A HREF="syoshimo.html">Banana Yoshimoto's <I>Kitchen</I></A>, I just had to have it.  She says:  "This <I>katsudon</I>, encountered almost by accident, was made with unusual skill, I must say.  Good quality meat, excellent broth, the eggs and onions handled beautifully, the rice with just the right degree of firmness to hold up the broth--it was flawless."  
<P>
Thus began my search for <I>katsudon</I> on my last two days in Japan.  I scoured Kamakura in between shrines--no luck.  I beat the streets of Nobi. <I>Iie.</I>  With only hours left before my departure, only the Highlands are left to me.  Darkness is falling...a storm is whipping up...I need to get home to make dinner and am anxious to spend my last moments with new granddaughter Billie.  One restaurant after another sends me away, and I am now on backstreets I haven't been before.  I feel like I am a character in <I>Kitchen</I>.  I walk past a corner shop that looks like a restaurant, though no plastic food is on display, hesitate, then go on, determined to give up this fruitless search.  Halfway down the block, I stop.  I am certain that I've given up at the wrong moment.  Something draws me back.  I push through the doors into an elegant establishment--all tatami mats, natural cedar woods and black lacquer.  Only a few tables for two are scattered around the large open room, but sandals and sneakers are lined up outside a long series of doors on the far side of the room.  I walk over to the counter in the back and am met by a man in a black kimono.  <I>"Katsudon o kudasai?"</I> I say--"Could you give me katsudon?"  He emphatically crosses his arms in front of him:  <I>"Iie, iie katsudon"</I>--"No, no katsudon!"  I pursue the conversation, making a dumbshow of wanting to find it somewhere in town.  <I>"Iie, iie katsudon,"</I> he says--holding his crossed arms forward at me.  Okay, fine, I leave.  When I get home, though, I recommend the place to my kids--"Well," I say, "it looks like a romantic place to eat, with most of the food being served in private dining rooms."  My son looks at me in complete disbelief.  "Mom," he says, "you're not ever going to find <I>katsudon</I> at a love hotel."
<P>
Serve this piping hot as a meal to 4 people.

<UL>
<LI>1 and 3/4 cups <A HREF="frice.html">short-grain rice</A>
<LI>2 cups water
<LI>4 <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork cutlets</A>, breaded by dipping each in beaten <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg</A>, then <A HREF="bthicken.html">fresh bread crumbs</A>
<LI>1 small <A HREF="fleek.html">leek</A>, sliced
<LI>2 and 1/2 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">Dashi stock</A>
<LI>1/2 cup <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">mirin</A> (sweet rice cooking wine)
<LI>1/3 cup <A HREF="fbeans.html">soy sauce</A>
<LI>6 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">eggs</A>
</UL>
Prepare the rice an hour before the meal.  First wash and rinse it well, then soak in lots of water for 30 minutes.  Strain, then put in a saucepan (or rice cooker) with the 2 cups of water.  Bring to a boil, cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes.  Turn off the heat and let steam for another 15 minutes (no peeking!).
<P>
Bring the dashi, mirin, and soy sauce to a boil, add the sliced leek, and simmer til soft.
<P>
When you are ready to assemble the meal, deep fry the pork cutlets til golden and tender, drain on paper towels.
<P>
Half fill four large bowls with the hot rice.  Slice each pork cutlet diagonally into 4 strips, and arrange each intact cutlet on the rice.
<P>
Whisk the eggs with chopsticks, then pour slowly into one spot over the onion into the dashi.  When the egg is nearly set, stir once.  Ladle a quarter of the egg mass on top of the first bowl, taking care you can still see the crisp cutlet beneath; then follow with the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th bowls. Distribute any remaining broth evenly among the bowls.  Serve immediately.
