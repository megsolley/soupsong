<H5>Not as complicated as it sounds, this meal for 4 is quick to make, rich and satisfying, yet delicate and elegant.  Serve hot to 4 people as a meal the next time you find big fat ocean scallops on sale.  It really is a treat.    </H5>

In a saucepan, melt butter, add minced shallots, mushrooms, and asparagus, and saute on low heat for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.  When flavors are concentrated, stir in the flour and cook for a minute or two, then slowly whisk in the milk.  When the soup heats and begins to thicken, whisk in the fish or seafood stockbase and let simmer for a minute or two.
<P>
Add the scallops, asparagus tips, and mushroom slices and simmer for 3 minutes.  Pour in the heavy cream, reheat, and simmer for a few more minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, pour in the wine, then ladle the soup into soup bowls, evenly dividing the scallops, mushroom slices, and asparagus tips.  Garnish with a pinch of fresh paprika over each bowl and serve immediately.
