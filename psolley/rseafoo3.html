<H5>This superb French institution makes an unconscionably good meal--this particular recipe for 8 people.  Compare Thackeray's unabashed rhapsodic ballad with Norman Douglas's corner-of-the-mouth remark:
<P>The Ballad of Bouillabaisse<P>
<IMG height=275 width=275 SRC="book.gif" align="right">
A street there is in Paris famous,<BR>
For which no rhyme our language yields,<BR>
Rue Neuve des Petit Champs its name is--<BR>
The New Street of the Little Fields.<BR>
And here's an inn, not rich and splendid<BR>
But still in comfortable ease;<BR>
The which I oft in youth attended,<BR>
To eat a bowl of Bouillabaisse.
<P>
This Bouillabaisse a noble dish is--<BR>
A sort of soup, or broth, or brew,<BR>
Or hotchpotch of all sorts of fishes,<BR>
That Greenwich never could outdo:<BR>
Green herbs, red peppers, mussels, saffron,<BR>
Soles, onion, garlic, roach, and dace:<BR>
All these you eat at Terre's tavern<BR>
in that one dish of Bouillabaisse.
<P>
Indeed a rich a savory stew 'tis;<BR>
And true philosophers, methinks,<BR>
Who love all sorts of natural beauties,<BR>
Should love good victuals and good drinks.<BR>
And Cordelier or Benedictine<BR>
Might gladly, sure, his lot embrace,<BR>
Nor find a fast day too afflicting,<BR>
Which served him up a Bouillabaisse.
<P>
Now here's Norman Douglas, author of the febrile <I>South Wind</I>:  "Bouillabaisse is only good because cooked by the French, who, if they cared to try, could produce an excellent and nutritious substitute out of cigar stumps and empty match boxes."
<P>
And, for heaven's sake, don't fail to read either Joseph Mery's <A HREF="sbouill2.html">"Recipe for Bouillabaisse</A> or John Lanchester's riff on it and other fish soups in <A HREF="slanches.html"><I>A Debt to Pleasure.</I></A></H5>
