<H5>Lovely to look at and more satisfying than you would expect from such slender ingredients because of the multi-sensory appeal, this delicate <I>suimono</I> soup makes an elegant first course...or final course for that matter.  For more information on Japanese soup customs, click <A HREF="zmay01.html">HERE.</A> Serve hot as a first--or last--course to 4 people. </H5>

<LI>1 boned <A HREF="fmeat.html">chicken breast</A>, trimmed and cut into small bite-sized cubes
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>4 dried <A HREF="fmushroo.html">shiitake mushrooms</A>, soaked in warm water with 1 teaspoon <A HREF="fsugar.html">sugar</A> for 30 minutes, cutting off stem, then sliced finely
<LI>1 small <A HREF="fleek.html">leek</A>, sliced very finely
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">dashi</A>
</UL>
Salt the little chicken cubes lightly, then simmer in water until just barely tender.  Remove from heat and reserve.
<P>
Bring the dashi to a simmer, then add the chicken pieces and shiitake mushroom slices.  Bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes.  Strain out the chicken and mushrooms and arrange evenly and in patterns in the 4 soup bowls.  Ladle the hot dashi over these bits, sprinkle each bowl with thinly sliced leeks, cover with lids, and serve immediately.
