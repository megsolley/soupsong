<I>"But even better is a borshch, prepared with beets, Ukrainian style, you know the way, my friend, with ham and country sausages.  It should be served with sour cream, of course, and a sprinkling of fresh parsley and dill."</I><BR>

<HR>
<H5>This fabulous, many layered, complex borshch is compliments of S&#225;ndor Fenyvesi, an air traffic controller in Budapest, Hungary, who was educated at a special school for navigating officers and air traffic controllers in Riga, Latvia, when he was 18 years old and learned this soup while there.  S&#225;ndor has an outstanding bilingual website of soup recipes at <A HREF="http://www.cookbook.hu">www.cookbook.hu</A>.  Most derive from his wife Katya, a wonderful cook.  Serve this authentic Ukrainian soup hot to 6-8 people as a substantial first course or as a main course.  For the story of borshch, click <A HREF="rbeet2.html">HERE.</A> </H5>

Heat the stock in a large soup pot, add cabbage and potatoes and simmer for 15 minutes.
<P>
In the meantime, mix the beets, vinegar, bacon fat, sugar, and tomatoes in a saucepan and cook gently, covered, for about 5 minutes.  Set aside. Then, in another small pan, heat the butter, mix in the onion, carrot, and parsley root (or parsnip), and braise.
<P>
When the cabbage and potatoes are finished simmering, add the beet mixture, the onion mixture, the peppercorns, allspice berries, and bay leaves--and cook another 10 minutes.
<P>
Stir in the chopped garlic, the remaining bacon fat, and the chopped parsley.  Then turn the heat down to a very low simmer, lightly cover the pot, and simmer very slowly for about 4&#189; hours.  Turn off the heat, let cool, and allow to ripen for about 12-18 hours.
<P>
When ready to serve, reheat gently then ladle into bowls.  Top each with a teaspoonful of sour cream and serve with a slice of dark rye bread.
