<H5>I can't improve on Norma Wasserman-Miller's <I>Soups of Italy</I> (NY: William Morrow, 1998), in which she describes the evolving role of soup through Italy's historical and economic past.  Her book is wonderful, and I recommend it.  What follows is a summary of her key points.</H5>
<HR>

Soup today is one of the major entries to the <I>primo piatto</I>, the first course of an Italian meal.  But it was not always so.  Soup began its life largely as a product of <I>la cucina povera</I>, the poor kitchen--far from the splendors of <I>cucina nobile</I>, the cuisine of nobility.  As such, it was crude, it was filling, and it was regional.
<P>
Marco Apicio's ancient cookbook <I>De Re Coquinaria</I> described <I>polus</I>, a Roman dish dating back to 30 AD made up of farro, chickpeas, and fava beans, with onions, garlic, lard, and greens thrown in.
<P>
During the Middle Ages, specific foods became associated with social classes:  onions, cabbages, and root vegetables for the peasants; fruits and delicate vegetables for the nobility.  Giacomo Albini, physician to the house of Savoy, developed a theory that members of these classes would become ill if they strayed away from foods appropriate to themselves, and he warned the rich to stay away from heavy soups.
<P>
<I>Zuppa</I>, from the Greek <I>suppa</I> (or "a slice of bread, soaking") likely evolved from food on bread trenchers...to it all cooked in warming broths.  <A HREF="rspinach.html"><I>Acquacotta</I></A> (cooked water) and <I>pancotta</I> (cooked bread) thus became the first rudimentary soups and a staple of the common people.
<P>
Then America was discovered--and by an Italian.   As potatoes, corn, zucchini, pumpkins, tomatoes, sweet peppers, and kidney beans flooded into Italy, <I>minestrone</I> was born.  How did it get its name?  From <I>minestra</I>, because the clergy would "minister" to the poor by ladling up soup to them out of vast cauldrons.  Remember friar Melitone, in Verdi's <A HREF="imusic.html">"La Forza del Destino"</A>, taking soup out of the convent Madonna degli Angeli to feed the poor, but instead abusing them--threatening them with his ladle--and finally kicking over the whole kettle and chasing them from the courtyard. 
<P>
Soup began to get a good name in 1790, when Francesco Leonardi published <I>L'Apicio moderno</I>, a 6-volume encyclopedia of Italian gastronomy.  Leonardi, chef to Louis XV and Catherine II devoted the first volume to <I>zuppa e minestre</I>--and he extolled a few of the recipes as <I>un piatto da offrire a dei principi</I>, a "dish fit for princes."
<P>
From there it was a cakewalk through acceptance by a growing middle class, through reunification, through the growth of cities and their restaurants, right to its present position of honor in the <I>primo piatto</I>.  
<P>
What are the various kinds of soup?  "The very same vegetables prepared as a light <I>minestra</I> can become a hearty <I>zuppa</I> simply by ladling it over slices of bread.  Increase the amount of bread and break it into pieces, which turns your soup into <I>pancotta</I>.  Puree those same vegetables and transform them into a delicate <I>crema</I>, or add beans and pasta for a substantial <I>minestrone</I>."
