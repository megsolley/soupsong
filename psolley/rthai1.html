Bring the stock to a boil in a large saucepan and stir in the lemon grass, 
ginger, and lime zest.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Add coconut 
milk and bring to a boil, stirring steadily.  Reduce heat and simmer until richly 
flavored, about 5 minutes.  Strain the soup into another saucepan (or just strain out the flavorings).  Stir in the chicken and mushrooms and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 2-3 minutes.  Stir in the dissolved cornstarch and bring to a boil to thicken slightly.  Remove from heat and stir in the nam pla, lime juice, basil, and chili peppers.  Correct the seasoning with more nam pla or lime, as you like.  Ladle soup into 4 bowls as a first course.
