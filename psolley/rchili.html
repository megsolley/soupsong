<H5>No matter where you're watching the game, and no matter how many snacks and munchies are lying around, there's just nothing like the taste of chili to pep up the plays.  This recipe is especially nice because, as a soup, it's not as filling as a pure chili con carne, but it's wonderfully authentic...creating a perfect small sweat on the back of your head.  Just what this year's fans in "freezing" Tampa need.  Serve hot with tortilla chips to 8 stalwart fans.  </H5>

Brown the beef in a large saucepan until oil forms in the pan.  Toss in the onions, garlic, and all the peppers and saut&#233; until soft.  Stir in the chopped tomatoes (reserving juice) and let them cook down over medium heat for about 10 minutes.  Stir in the vinegar, and let it cook down.  Pour in the reserved tomato juice, the beef stock, and the tomato paste.  Bring to a boil.  Add the beans and let boil for several minutes.  Reduce the heat, stir in the chili powder and cumin, partially cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes.

When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with grated cheese and chopped cilantro.  Pass a bowl of tortilla chips while you're at it.
