<H5>This chunky, colorful soup is full of flavor and very filling.  It's a great harvest soup, excellent at the end of summer with vegetables from the garden, right at the point that there just starts to be a nip in the air.  Many thanks to Bethany Gronberg from Omaha, Nebraska, for contributing...and to her friend Cathy Blair for creating it in the first place.  Serve hot to 4 people as a meal, with bread and salad on the side.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>1/2 pound <A HREF="fmeat.html">bacon</A>, cut into 1-inch pieces
<LI>2 <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>, chopped
<LI>2 quarts <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A> (or 1 28-ounce can), skinned and cut up with juice
<LI>2 <A HREF="fpotato.html">potatoes</A>, diced
<LI>2 ears fresh <A HREF="fcorn.html">corn</A>, cut off cob
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  1 cup <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">heavy cream</A>, swirled in at the end (or, alternately, stirred into the pot just before serving)
<P>
Cook the bacon until completely cooked, but not crisp.  Drain off all but 2 Tablespoons of the fat, then toss in onions and saute until transparent.  Pour in the tomato bits and juice, bring to a boil and add potatoes.  Reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender.  Scrape in corn kernels and cook for 5-10 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, you can either stir the cream into the pot...or ladle the noncreamy soup into bowls and separately swirl 4 Tablespoons of cream into each.
