<H5>William Kennedy tells the story of this soup in his middle outstanding work of the Albany trilogy, <I>Billy Phelan's Greatest Game.</I>  Billy's father, caught in a defining moment in his younger days, falls into the itinerant world of the homeless.  Down on his luck, he returns to Albany as an old man and momentarily revives himself with a soup taught to him in Texas by a Mexican bum.</H5>
