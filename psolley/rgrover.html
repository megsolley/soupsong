<H5>Here's to Grover, my server wizard, who houses this website and who has met all my not-so-smart questions and requests with infinite patience and humor. Thank you, Grover.  I think this rich and visual vegetarian brew--based on a peppery tomato soup of the Tarascan Indians (Michoacan, Mexico)--begins to approach my take on your own complexity and love of art. Serve hot to 6-8 people who aren't afraid of hot chile peppers!  It's good as a light lunch or substantial first course. </H5>

<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>1 medium <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, chopped
<LI>3 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, mashed then lightly chopped
<LI>2 red <A HREF="fpepper.html">peppers</A>, chopped
<LI>1 1-pound can of dark <A HREF="fbeans.html#red beans">red kidney beans</A> (with juice)
<LI>1 cup fresh or canned <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomatoes</A>, chopped
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#vegetable stock">vegetable stock</A>
<LI>1 6-ounce can of <A HREF="ftomato.html">tomato paste</A>
<LI>2 large dried <A HREF="fpepper.html"><I>ancho</I> chilies</A>, soaked in hot water, seeded, then cut into thin strips that can easily fit on a soupspoon
<LI>1 teaspoon <A HREF="foregano.html">oregano</A>, crushed between your palms
<LI>1/2 teaspoon <A HREF="fcumin.html">cumin</A>
<LI>1/2 teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">black pepper</A>
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I> 1 cup finely grated <A HREF="fcheese.html">smoked cheese (cheddar or edam)</A> beaten with 1 cup <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">sour cream</A>; finely minced <A HREF="fcilantr.html">cilantro</A>; big tortilla chips
<P>
In a large saucepan, saute the onion, garlic, and red pepper in oil until the onion is just beginning to brown.
<P>
While vegetables are cooking, puree the kidney beans with their juice and with the  tomatoes in a blender til smooth.
<P>
When the onions are done, pour in the stock, puree, tomato paste, ancho chilies, oregano, cumin, and black pepper.  Stir well, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 45 minutes--stirring occasionally.
<P>
When ready to serve, grate the cheese and beat it into the sour cream.  Mince the cilantro.  Then ladle soup into flat soup bowls.  Spoon the cheese-cream thickly in a cross shape (for Grover's patience) across each bowl--sprinkle with cilantro--and stick one tortilla chip in the center.  Pass a bowl of tortilla chips separately.
<P>
Thanks again, Grover!
