Shallots, like garlic, grow in a cluster of bulbs--usually covered by reddish paper membrane, but sometimes by a purpley or greenish paper.  By reputation, they are said to have first sprouted in ancient Ashkelon, where Delilah shore Samson's tresses.  Thus their name <I>ascalonicum</I>.
<P>
Known for their distinctive and slightly garlic taste, they are the darlings of French cooking--and also beloved in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.  It's said that, no matter where or how they're grown, they never develop a sharpness that will overpower a dish or sauce.
<P>
Consider, in that context, the anonymous ancient Chinese poet's eschatological reflection on "The Dew that on Shallot-leaves Lies," dating back to Western Han dynasty" (trans., J.A. Turner):
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>How soon in sunlight dries<BR>
The dew that on shallot-leaves lies!<BR>
Yet the same dew,<BR>
Though now 'tis dry,<BR>
Tomorrow morn will fall anew.<BR>
But when shall mortal men,<BR>
If once they die,<BR>
Ever return again?</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
