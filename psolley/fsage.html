Similarly, an Arabian proverb says, "Why should a man die who has sage in his garden."  Indeed, its health giving properties were so well regarded that it was called "sage" from the Latin <I>salvere</I> meaning "to save."  In fact, an essential oil distilled from its dried leaves is used medicinally as an antibiotic.  Also, an herbal tea made from its leaves is reputed to be so effective in aiding digestion that the Chinese once bartered their own teas for sage from the West.
