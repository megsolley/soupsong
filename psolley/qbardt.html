<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
AUTOLYCUS:       When daffodils begin to peer,<BR>
        With heigh! the doxy over the dale,<BR>
        Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;<BR>
        For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.<BR>
<P>
        The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,<BR>
        With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!<BR>
        Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;<BR>
        For a quart of <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">ale</A> is a dish for a king.<BR>
<P>
        The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,<BR>
        With heigh! with heigh! the <A HREF="fmeat.html">thrush</A> and the jay,<BR>
        Are summer songs for me and my aunts,<BR>
        While we lie tumbling in the hay.

<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, II, 1</U>:<BR>
OBERON:    I pray thee, give it me.
        I know a bank where the <A HREF="fthyme.html">wild thyme</A> blows,
        Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
        Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
        With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
        There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
        Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight....
<P>
<U>Othello, The Moor of Venice, I, 3</U>:<BR>
IAGO:     Virtue! a <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A>! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
        or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
        our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
        <A HREF="fgreens.html">nettles</A>, or sow <A HREF="fgreens.html">lettuce</A>, set <A HREF="fhyssop.html">hyssop</A> and weed up
        <A HREF="fthyme.html">thyme</A>, supply it with one gender of <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">herbs</A>, or
        distract it with many, either to have it sterile
        with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
        power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
        wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
        scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
        blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
        to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
        reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
        stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
        you call love to be a sect or scion.

<U>King Henry IV, part 2, V, 4</U>:<BR>
DOLL TEARSHEET:    Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell
        thee what, thou damned <A HREF="fmeat.html">tripe-visaged</A> rascal, an
        the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert
        better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou
        paper-faced villain.
<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
GRUMIO:    I fear it is too choleric a meat.
        How say you to a <A HREF="fmeat.html">fat tripe</A> finely broil'd?

<U>Twelfth Night, II, 5</U>:<BR>
MARIA:   Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
        coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
        sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
        hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
        know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
        him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there, [Throws down a letter]
        for here comes the <A HREF="ffish.html">trout</A> that must be caught with tickling.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Turkey</H3>
<HR>
<U>King Henry V, V, 1</U>:<BR>
GOWER:   Why, here he comes, swelling like a <A HREF="fmeat.html">turkey-cock</A><BR>
FLUELLEN:      'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">turkey-cocks</A>. God pless you, Aunchient Pistol! you
        scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you!
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, II, 5</U>:<BR>
FABIAN:  O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare <A HREF="fmeat.html">turkey-cock</A>
        of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
<P>

<H3>Turtle-dove</H3>
<HR>
<U>King Henry VI, part 1, II, 2</U>:<BR>
BURGUNDY:        Myself, as far as I could well discern
        For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
        Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
        When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
        Like to a pair of loving <A HREF="fmeat.html">turtle-doves</A>
        That could not live asunder day or night.
        After that things are set in order here,
        We'll follow them with all the power we have.
<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, II, 1</U>:<BR>
PETRUCHIO:       O slow-wing'd <A HREF="ffish.html">turtle</A>! shall a buzzard take thee?<BR>
KATHARINA:       Ay, for a <A HREF="ffish.html">turtle</A>, as he takes a buzzard.
<P>
<U>Troilus and Cressida, III, 2</U>:<BR>
TROILUS:   O virtuous fight,
        When right with right wars who shall be most right!
        True swains in love shall in the world to come
        Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
        Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
        Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
        As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
        As sun to day, as <A HREF="fmeat.html">turtle</A> to her mate,
        As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
        Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
        As truth's authentic author to be cited,
        'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
        And sanctify the numbers.
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, V, 3</U>:<BR>
PAULINA There's time enough for that;
        Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
        Your joys with like relation. Go together,
        You precious winners all; your exultation
        Partake to every one. I, an old <A HREF="fmeat.html">turtle</A>,
        Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
        My mate, that's never to be found again,
        Lament till I am lost.
<P>
