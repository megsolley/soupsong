<HR>
<H5>Cool, clean, tart, and stimulating, that's this soup, some interesting combination of Turkish <I>Cacik</I> and Polish <I>Chlodnik</I>--and so lovely in presentation.  Recipe contributor Ruth Long clipped it from The Washington Post back in the 1970s and has served it to acclamation in many different countries while entertaining throughout her family's life in the foreign service.  Serve as a first course on a hot summer day to 6. </H5>
