Melt the butter in a Dutch oven and add the onions, stirring constantly.  cook for 5-7 minutes, until soft.
<P>
In the meantime, cut slices of French bread into 1/2 inch pieces and toast them at 350 degrees in the oven for about 15 minutes--until they are dry crusts.

When the onions are soft, sprinkle them with flour, stir, then add 2 cups of beef stock and stir until the mixture is thickened.  Add the remaining stock, stir into 1 Tablespoon of salt, the pepper, and the brandy.  Bring to a boil.  Cover and simmer for 1/2 hour to an hour.  Add the meat glaze and taste for seasoning.
<P>
When you're ready to serve, ladle the soup into individual bowls and cover each with a thick handful of Gruyere cheese.  Top each with a piece of the toasted bread, which has been drizzled with olive oil.  Sprinkle it with the Parmesan, then run them under a broiler for a few minutes and carry out to the table.
