<HR>
<H5>This marvelous, authentic, and aromatic Icelandic soup is compliments of Nanna Rögnvaldardóttir, author of <I>Matarást</I> ( or, <I>Love of Food</I>), a 700-page compendium of some 1,600 recipes and 3,000 entries in the first ever Icelandic cooking encyclopedia.  This soup, which is taken from <I>Matar&#225;st</I>, is--according to Nanna--what most Icelanders consider THE Icelandic soup, though she adds that "it is
not really unique; Scottish and Welsh lamb soups are very similar and I´ve
even got a Mongolian recipe for lamb soup (Guriltai shul) that is remarkably
similar, except the meat is briefly stir-fried in the beginning, but the
vegetables are exactly the same."  That, of course, is a lesson in the transmigration of recipes.  The fact remains, it's a hearty, wholesome, protein-rich soup that looks positively festive in the bowl when the vegetables are cut into a same-size dice:  like a white-yellow-orange confetti soup.  Serve hot to 6-8 people as a substantial meal.</H5>

Nanna says: "Traditionally, fatty meat is used but many now prefer to remove most of the
fat. Place the meat and onion in a large pan and pour cold water over it.
Heat to boiling point, let boil rapidly for a few minutes, then skim. Add
dried vegetables and some salt and pepper and simmer for around 40 minutes.
Add rutabagas, potatoes and carrots and simmer for 20-25 minutes more, or
until all the vegetables are tender. Season to taste. The meat is either
served in the soup or removed and served on a separate plate, but it is
always eaten with the soup. Some cut it up small, then add it back to the
soup, others would eat it from a separate plate.
<P>
"Other versions of the soup may add or substitute other vegetables, like
cabbage, kale or turnips, and a fistful of oats or rice was sometimes added to thicken it somewhat, but this is the version I like best; simple, clear and thin but tasty."
<P>
I also like the pure version, but tried the one with oatmeal too.  It's excellent--very "stick to your ribs."  It's also good the next day--and easy to pick the solid fat off after refrigeration.
