<H5>Ooh, this is sinfully--and I use the word advisedly--rich...as an aphrodisiac soup should be.  Serve hot in a bower of bliss to two--an appetizer to the main course of your choice! </H5>

<UL>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="fnuts.html">pine nuts</A>
<LI>3 raw <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg yolks</A>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">light cream</A>
<LI>1/8 teaspoon <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A>
</UL>

<I>Garnish:</I> a splash of <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">cream</A>, swirled in the middle of each bowl

In a blender, puree the pine nuts and egg yolks, dribbling in the chicken stock a bit at a time until it pulls together and makes a very smooth paste.  Continue adding the rest of the stock, slowly, then the cream, until the liquid is completely smooth.  Pour into a medium saucepan.  At this point, heat the saffron in a metal spoon until you can just smell it, then rub the crisped filaments between your palms into the soup, whisking well to distribute the color and flavor.  Heat the soup carefully over a very low heat--it must never boil or it will separate--until it is hot and thickened.  It will thicken quite well.  Taste and season with a pinch of salt--just enough to bring the flavor out.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and splash a bit of cream into the middle of each one, swirling for effect.
