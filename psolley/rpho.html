<HR>
<H5>The ultimate comfort food--and a snap to make once you get hold of all the ingredients. This version is the "most-accessible-to-Westerners," called <I>tai</I>.  Foodwriter Thy Tran notes, "Depending on personal tastes,
variations on ph&#243; would include crunchy tripe, tender long-cooked
brisket, savory beef balls, silky tendon" or come as a light chicken
version, ph&#243; ga. A good ph&#243; restaurant's menu would be expected to
list at least 15 to 20 of these."  Whatever your preference, this soup is delicate but filling; fragrant and satisfying--and historically interesting.  According to Thy (website at <A HREF="www.wanderingspoon.com">www.wanderingspoon.com</A>), ph&#243; is a blend of Mongolian beef hot pot (the Vietnamese were the only people who defeated the Khan's invading armies--that grilled their meat on their shields and made "hot pot" soup in their helmets), Chinese spices, and SE Asian herbs.
<P>
Serve hot as a meal in great big bowls to 6, with accompaniments and a bottle of chili-garlic sauce (<I>Tuong ot Toi Viet-Nam</I>, if you can get it) on the side. With love and thanks to once friend--now beloved daughter-in-law--Angi for addicting me to this marvelous soup.</H5>

<LI>&#189; pound <A HREF="fpasta.html">ph&#243; rice noodles</A> (these can be the real thing, <I>banh ph&#243;</I>, or rice sticks or any rice noodle at all.  If you use wheat-based vermicelli or capelli d'angelo, it will still be good, but it won't really be ph&#243;)
<LI>8 cups light <A HREF="bstock.html#beef stock vietnam">spiced beef stock</A> (if you don't have time to make this hyperlinked vietnamese beef stock recipe, you can do a quick approximation by diluting a commercial beef stock--bouillon cube, can, or soup base--and simmering crushed <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger chunks</A>, sliced <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>, 2 <A HREF="bflavor.html#star anise">star anise</A>, a <A HREF="fbay.html">bay leaf</A>, and <A HREF="ffennel.html">fennel seeds</A> in the broth for 15-30 minutes, then straining)
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lime juice</A>
<LI>2-3 Tablespoons <A HREF="ffish.html"><I>nuoc mam</I></A> or other Southeast Asian fish sauce (see entry under <A HREF="ffish.html">fish</A>)
<LI>&#190; pound slab of boneless <A HREF="fmeat.html">beef</A> (top round is fine), partially frozen then sliced into paper thin slices
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Accompaniments:</I> &#188; cup <A HREF="fgronion.html">green onions</A>, sliced; &#189; cup <A HREF="fbasil.html">small-leaf basil</A>; 2 cups fresh <A HREF="fbeans.html#mung beans">beansprouts</A>; 6 <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lime slices</A>; finely sliced <A HREF="fpepper.html">jalapeno peppers</A>; and <A HREF="ffish.html">nuoc mam</A>.
<P>
Cook the noodles in boiling water for 5 minutes, then drain (or follow package directions for whatever noodles you're using).
<P>
Heat spiced beef stock, lime juice, and <I>nuoc mam</I> in a large non-aluminum saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer the broth for about 30 minutes.
<P>
Arrange green onions, basil, bean sprouts, chiles, and lime slices on a platter.
<P>
When ready to serve, distribute the noodles evenly among the deep bowls, then top with meat slices.  Pour the hot broth over both, filling the bowl, and serve immediately, with porcelain spoons and chopsticks and with the platter of accompaniments, <I>nuoc mam</I>, and chili sauce on the side.
<P>
Okay, one last note from Thy, who writes about going to a purist ph&#243; house in San Francisco:  "Although I often order
<I>tai </I>on the side, I've never before had a separate bowl of hot broth brought
to the table for cooking the meat. I remember my mom saying how much
she hated it when the broth was clouded by the <I>tai </I>slices (which is
why she would have a little pot of stock for dipping the meat before
ladling in broth from a bigger pot.) But I thought that a little much
even back then. Still, she'd have been proud of how clear my broth was
to the last sip."
