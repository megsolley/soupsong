<HR>
<H5>This marvelous cold fruit soup was contributed by Lisa Gitelson.  She says it best:  "give it a try on a hot summer's night, don't tell your guests what's in it, and they will fall in love."  Serve cold in flat bowls to 6-8 as a tantalizing first course. No-fat and low-fat yoghurt work beautifully.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>1 quart <A HREF="fberry.html">strawberries</A>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="fsugar.html">sugar</A>
<LI>6 Tablespoons <A HREF="bflavor.html#vinegar">balsamic vinegar</A>
<LI>1/2 teaspoon finely grated <A HREF="fcitrus.html">orange zest</A>
<LI>1/2 teaspoon finely grated <A HREF="fcitrus.html">lemon zest</A>
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">Grand Marnier</A> (or <A HREF="fcitrus.html">orange juice</A>)
<LI>6 cups plain <A HREF="bthicken.html#yoghurt">yoghurt</A>
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I> Toss 20 halved <A HREF="fberry.html">strawberries</A> (over and above the quart of strawberries you used for the soup) with 1/2 cup sugar and 2 Tablespoons of <A HREF="bflavor.html#vinegar">balsamic vinegar</A> and macerate for at least 2 hours at room temperature or in the fridge.
<P>
Puree the strawberries with the sugar, vinegar, zests, and Grand Marnier.  Make sure the sugar has completely dissolved--and let it sit for a few minutes if it hasn't.  Whip the yoghurt in a bowl, then stir in the puree until smooth.  Chill well, at least two hours.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle the soup into flat bowls and top with the macerated strawberries.  Drizzle a few teaspoonsful of the strawberry syrup over each bowls in a dashing pattern.
