<HR>
<H5>This is composed of two separate soups, each of which can be served by itself.  The duet of the two soups can be served either hot or cold, depending on the season and the menu.  Together, they make a spectacular presentation--and set off the most unusual palate explosions.

<H4>YELLOW SOUP</H4>

<LI>3 <A HREF="fpepper.html">yellow peppers</A>, roasted, peeled, seeded, cored, and chopped, as above
<LI>1 small <A HREF="fpotato.html">potato</A>, cubed

<LI>milk, to thin
</UL>
Combine peppers, potato, stock, crushed saffron, salt, and pepper in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes--until the potatoes are tender.  Puree until very smooth, mix in cream, then add milk until the soup is approximately the same consistency as the red soup.  Return to the pan and keep warm until ready to serve.  (Contrariwise, refrigerate until very cold.)

<H4>THE DUET</H4>
When ready to serve, adjust seasoning of both soups, depending on how it tastes hot or cold.  Then, in a flat soup bowl, simultaneously pour the soups from different containers on opposite sides of it (about 1/2-3/4 cup of each), until they meet in the middle.  Then, with a sharp knife point, slice the red soup a few times into the yellow soup, to make an abstract design that pleases you.  Garnish with a single cilantro or parsley sprig.
