<HR>
<H5>A perfect summer soup that's an absolutely gorgeous shade of day glo pink.  This traditional Lithuanian soup (meaning "cold beet soup") is stuffed with crisp and tender textures--all of them bold in flavor--and delivered in a refreshingly cold and sour buttermilk broth. Many thanks for this outstanding recipe to Pasaka and Jonas Griciai, both physicians who live in Vilnius with their dog, Picasso. Pasaka correctly notes it is "one of the most refreshing, delicious, and ridiculously easy to make summer soups out there"--and she doesn't even like beets!  Serve ice cold as a light summer meal to 4-6 people with fresh boiled potatoes, also sprinkled with dill.

Whisk the buttermilk in a large bowl, then add the rest of the ingredients.  You may add cold water or ice cubes if the soup is too rich or thick for your tastes.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H5>A second opinion!  Marilyn Janunas of Las Vegas writes to say:  "If you don't like buttermilk you can use a large container of sour cream and then add some water to it. Also, for us lazy ones, we can use a couple of cans of 'shoestring beets,' which are sold in most supermarkets. We even add a little vinegar and sugar to it. Just thinking about this makes my mouth water. My mother always made this for the family in the summer. It's a cool refreshing soup. Enjoy!!"</H5></BLOCKQUOTE>
