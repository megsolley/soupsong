<BLOCKQUOTE>Augustus was a chubby lad;
<BR>Fat, ruddy cheeks Augustus had;
<BR>And everybody saw with joy
<BR>The plump and hearty, healthy boy.
<BR>He ate and drank as he was told,
<BR>And never let his soup get cold.
<P>
But one day, one cold winter's day,
<BR>He screamed out--"Take the soup away!
<BR>O take the nasty soup away!
<BR>I won't have any soup today!"
<P>
Next day begins his tale of woes;
<BR>Quite lank and lean Augustus grows.
<BR>Yet, though he feels so weak and ill,
<BR>The naughty fellow cries out still--
<BR>"Not any soup for me, I say:
<BR>O take the nasty soup away!
<BR>I won't have any soup today."
<P>
The third day comes; O what a sin!
<BR>To make himself so pale and thin.
<BR>Yet, when the soup is put on table,
<BR>He screams as loud as he is able--
<BR>"Not any soup for me, I say:
<BR>O take the nasty soup away!
<BR>I won't have any soup today."
<P>
<IMG height=150 width=200 SRC="grave.gif" align="right">
Look at him, now the fourth day's come!
<BR>He scarcely weighs a sugar-plum;
<BR>He's like a little bit of thread,
<BR>And on the fifth day, he was---dead!</BLOCKQUOTE>
