<H5>Another one for curiosity seekers.  In the Star Trek cookbook of the 24th century, Neelix tries his hand at replicating Kirk's stab at Spock's favorite soup.  Possibly where no gastronome has gone or would want to go before.  Neelix says, "Spock's passion for plomeek soup is legendary throughout Starfleet mainly because he once hurled a bowl of it at Nurse Chapel.  All Vulcans love plomeek soup.  That's why I learned to make it.  This version is creamier and spicier.  Whose recipe is more Vulcan, Kirk's or mine?  You be the judge.  Serve them side by side in a blind taste test." I say, caveat emptor. I'd have to be pretty hungry to eat either.<P>And I also say that, thanks to Jill McGown, Neelix and Captain Kirk are revealed for the frauds they are.  Mr. Spock would NEVER eat a soup with a chicken stock base. Right from the start, everyone knew that Mr. Spock was a vegetarian, like all Vulcans.  Yes, okay, Vulcans began as a warring, violent race, but they saved themselves from destruction by adopting a philosophy of logic and nonviolence. The nonviolent ethic is captured in the Vulcan credo of IDIC, the Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination, asserting that the glory of creation lies in its diversity and in the many ways those differences combine to create meaning and beauty.  Extinction is anathema under the IDIC philosophy, and it is no more logical to kill another species for food than it is to hunt it to extinction.  This credo he reveals in "All Our Yesterdays," "City on the Edge of Forever," "The Enterprise Incident," and the cartoon "The Slaver Incident." I don't care if Spock DID hurl the Plomeek Soup at Nurse Chapel.  Serve, if you must, hot to 6 people.  But please substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock. </H5>

<P>
Melt the &#189; butter in a saucepan and saute the onions over low heat until transparent.  Add the remaining butter, melt, and add the carrots--cooking over low heat until browned, about 30 minutes.  Add the celery and cook 10 more minutes on low heat. Pour in the stock, salt, and pepper, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let soup simmer for about an hour.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls--unless you want to try Captain Kirk's version.  In that case, go ahead and stir in the cream.  Much good it will do you.
