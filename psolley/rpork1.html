<H5>A sloppy soup to eat, but fun and savory.  Those crazy cellophane noodles slip all over the place, no matter what you try--the best strategy is a combination of spoon, chopsticks, and picking up the bowl and drinking it.  Serve hot to 4-6 people as a first course.</H5>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="fpasta.html">cellophane (bean thread) noodles</A>, soaked in cold water for 15 minutes, then cut into 6-inch lengths
<LI>6 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1/2 cup <A HREF="fmeat.html">smoked ham</A>, finely chopped
<LI>1/2 cup <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork</A>, ground
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="fwaterch.html">water chestnuts</A>, minced
<LI>1/2 teaspoon <A HREF="bthicken.html">cornstarch</A>
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="fbeans.html#soybeans">soy sauce</A>
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I>  2 Tablespoons <A HREF="fgronion.html">green onions</A>, minced
<P>
Boil the stock in a large saucepan and stir in the soaked and cut cellophane noodles.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
<P>
Meanwhile, mix together the minced ham, pork, and water chestnuts with the cornstarch and soy sauce.
<P>
Shape the meat into little balls and drop into the soup.  Continue cooking over moderate heat for another 15 minutes.  Taste.  If the broth is too concentrated, dilute with a little water.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with scallions.  Arm your guests with any tools they ask for and promise not to laugh as they slurp away.
