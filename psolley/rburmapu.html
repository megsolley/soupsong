<HR>
<H5>Really a lovely "sweet" Burmese soup--fragrant, spicy, and with an even balance between light and filling.  Will go well with a sandwich for lunch--or stimulate an appetite for a cold supper in the summer or a sustaining supper in the winter.  Or you can go traditional and serve it simultaneously with other Burmese dishes, where it will play the role of beverage.  Serve warm to 4 people as a course.</H5>

<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="bflavor.html">peanut oil</A>
<LI>3 cloves <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, coarsely chopped
<LI>1 and 1/2 pounds <A HREF="fsquash.html">pumpkin</A> or other winter squash, peeled, seeded, and cubed
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A> (or, traditionally, water)
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A> to taste
<LI>1/2 cup Thai (or sweet) <A HREF="fbasil.html">basil leaves</A>, finely sliced
</UL></DL>
 <P>
Heat oil in a medium saucepan, then lightly saute the garlic for 3-5 minutes, until it is fragrant.  Add the cubed pumpkin and stock to the pan and bring to a boil.  Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 25 minutes, until pumpkin is tender.  Puree in a blender, solids first, until smooth.  Season with salt and pepper.  When ready to serve, stir in finely sliced basil and ladle into bowls.
