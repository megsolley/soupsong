Richard Tavis of San Francisco swears by the buttermilk option and suggests a couple jolts of hot pepper sauce (Tabasco) to set off the crab.

<H5>This is one great meal--thick, creamy, and rich, with the white of crab and potatoes contrasted with the yellow corn and green celery leaves.  It's simple and quick to make, immensely satisfying, and quite spectacular as company food.  Serve hot as a meal to 4 people...or as a substantial first course to 8.  </H5>
