Bring stock and water to a boil.  Add garlic, then reduce heat and gently simmer for 30 minutes.  Cool completely.  Cover and refrigerate overnight.
<P>
Reheat stock to a boil, then remove garlic.  Reserve a couple cloves for the soup; otherwise, use the rest for another part of the meal, if you like--it's quite mellow at this point.  Reduce heat to a bare simmer, allow a few minutes for the stock to cool a bit, thin slip in the chicken breast and poach for about 15 minutes.  It should be just opaque.  Remove and shred the chicken finely.
<P>
Beat the eggs in a small bowl, then whisk in 1/4 cup hot stock. Mix this mixture into the pot of simmering stock and stir for a few minutes to disperse the foam and thicken the soup.  Stir in the chicken and julienned reserved garlic.  Remove from heat, season with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and garnish with carrot and leek julienne and with minced parsley.
