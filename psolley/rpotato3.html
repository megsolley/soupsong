<H5>Soup Tale:  France was beset with famine following the Seven Year War (1756-1763).  Native son Antoine Auguste Parmentier, who had been fed the so-called poisonous potato root in a German prison-of-war camp, returned to France to find his country men starving.  He set up potato soup kitchens throughout Paris to assist the poor.  Ultimately, Louis XVI recognized his work by saying, "France will thank you some day for having found bread for the poor."  In fact, he is best honored by the pleasure his country take in digesting <I>Potage Parmentier.</I></H5>
