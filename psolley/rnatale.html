<H5>This recipe is such a snap, you can make it in 15 minutes if you have the ingredients on hand.  Of course it's nice and traditional to make it from scratch, too, especially for <I>i primi</I> of Christmas dinner.  This dish is local to the Isle of Capri, reputedly home of witches.  Delicate in taste, but also substantial, you may serve it piping hot to 6-8 people, singing Christmas carols as you bring it to the table.</H5>

Bring the stock to a boil, stir in lemon peel, bay leaves, and grated onion, reduce heat and let simmer 10 minutes.  When ready to serve, bring the soup back to a boil, then stir in the escarole and chicken.  Reduce heat, let simmer another 5 minutes.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately, passing the Parmesan cheese separately for sprinkling.
