<LI>1 and 1/2 quarts of boiling water
<LI>1/2 teaspoon of <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
<LI>1 and 1/2 Tablespoon of <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>
<LI>2 Tablespoons of <A HREF="bthicken.html">flour</A>
<LI>2 <A HREF="bthicken.html#eggs">egg yolks</A>

Trim the cauliflower and it into bite-size buds, but keep the stalks and trimmings for the stock. Put the cauliflower stalks and trimmings into a large saucepan of the  boiling water and salt, then-- If you have a steaming basket--stick the steaming basket on top and add the buds (otherwise you'll have to pick through the stuff to fish out the buds with a slotted spoon).  Cover and simmer until the buds are just tender, then pull the basket out with the buds and cool.  Continue cooking the stalks and trimmings til they're very soft and mushy.  Strain, pitch the mushy cauliflower, and reserve the stock.
<P>
In a Dutch oven, melt the butter and stir in the flour.  When smooth, stir in the hot stock,  beating constantly, then cover and simmer for 10 or so minutes.  In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks and nutmeg into the whipping cream.  Remove the soup from the heat, then carefully and quickly whisk the egg mixture into the stock.  Adjust for seasoning and grate in some white pepper.  Return the soup to the lowest possible heat, for fear of curdling it, add the cauliflower buds, heat through, and serve immediately.  Garnish with a small sprinkling of nutmeg.
