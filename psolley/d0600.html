       <TD>Brendan Glackman reports on The Royal Breakthrough:  Queen Elizabeth finally agreeing to meet Prince Charles longtime mistress Camilla Parker Bowles at a tony luncheon barbeque at Highgrove in honor of King Constantine's birthday.  Prince Charles himself prepared and served gazpacho as the first course (with ingredients from his own organic garden)--the choice itself apparently signalled that the House of Windsor has forgotten its recent displeasure with the Spanish monarchy, itself signalled by the Duke of Edinburgh "innocently describing all Spaniards as 'greasy dagoes'."   Queen Elizabeth's sally?  Asking Charles if this was to be the "new Windsor soup."

His recovery has been understandably slow, but he had a breakthrough in feeding when a physiotherapist strapped a spoon to his right arm stump:  "Soon I could feed myself soup, an achievement which almost brought tears to my eyes."
