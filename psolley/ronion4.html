<H5>This delectable and delicate soup dates back to a 16th century cookbook, the first in the Spanish language, written by Ruperto de Nola, chef to King Ferdinando.  Serve hot as a first course to 6 people. </H5>

<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>2 large <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>, sliced thin
<LI>6 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1 cup dry <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">white wine</A>
<LI>1 <A HREF="fbay.html">bay leaf</A>
<LI>2 sprigs <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">white pepper</A> to taste

<I>Garnish:</I>  6 slices French-style bread, 1/4 inch thick, lightly toasted in the oven; &#189; &#189; cup <A HREF="fcheese.html">Parmesan cheese</A>, grated;  sliced toasted <A HREF="fnuts.html">almonds</A>  (the orginal recipe actually called for a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar, but that's just a quirk of those spice-mad Renaissance rascals!)
<P>

Heat the oil in a large pot, then saute the onion slices until they are wilted, not brown.  Add the stock, wine, bay leaf, parsley, salt, and pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes.
<P>
Take the almonds and grind them as finely as possible in a blender--then slowly add &#189; cup of the hot soup broth, blending it to a milky liquid.  Strain the broth back into the soup pot.  (If big chunks of almond are left, you can repeat the blending process--but be careful not to put any chunks of almond in the soup.  Stir in cumin.  Cover again and simmer 30 more minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, remove the parsley and bay leaf.  Ladle the soup into individual bowls and top each with a slice of toast sprinkled with cheese.  Run under a broiler for a minute until the bread and cheese are golden.  Serve immediately, sprinkled with the toasted almonds.
