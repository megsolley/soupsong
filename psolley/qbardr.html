<U>Pericles, IV, 6</U>:  <BR>
Bawd    She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
        come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
        to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
        Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with <A 
HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A> and <A HREF="fbay.html">bays</A>!
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
                       You're welcome, sir.
        Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
        For you there's <A HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A> and rue; these keep
        Seeming and savour all the winter long:
        Grace and remembrance be to you both,
        And welcome to our shearing!
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, II, 4</U>:<BR>
Nurse   Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
        Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
        is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
        lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
        see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
        sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
        man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
        as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
        <A HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A> and Romeo begin both with a letter?
<P>
...Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
        the--No; I know it begins with some other
        letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
        it, of you and <A HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A>, that it would do you good
        to hear it.
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, IV, 5</U>:<BR>

FRIAR LAURENCE         O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
        That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
        She's not well married that lives married long;
        But she's best married that dies married young.
        Dry up your tears, and stick your <A HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A>
        On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
        In all her best array bear her to church:
        For though fond nature bids us an lament,
        Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
<P>
<U>Hamlet, IV, 5</U>:
OPHELIA There's <A HREF="frosemar.html">rosemary</A>, that's for remembrance; pray,
        love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
<P>
<U>King Lear, II, 3</U>:
EDGAR   ... Whiles I may 'scape,
        I will preserve myself: and am bethought
        To take the basest and most poorest shape
        That ever penury, in contempt of man,
        Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
        Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
        And with presented nakedness out-face
        The winds and persecutions of the sky.
        The country gives me proof and precedent
        Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
        Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
        Pins, wooden pricks, nails, <A HREF="frosemar.html">sprigs of rosemary</A>;
        And with this horrible object, from low farms,
        Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
        Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
        Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
        That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.
