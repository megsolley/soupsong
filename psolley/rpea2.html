Aan de oever van de Nete<BR>
heb ik erwtensoep gegeten.<BR>
Wat mij danig heeft gespeten.<BR>
want ik liet heel vieze windjes.<P>
 
At the bank of the Nete (small river in Belgium)<BR>
       I had pea soup.<BR>
       But I regretted it for days<BR>
       because of the consequences.<BR>
--<I>translated by good friend W.H. van der Molen</I><p>
PLEASE NOTE: a more literal translation (kindly provided by Bruce Barbour of Ipswich) would actually include "release smelly farts"

The thickness of this soup recalls a <I>Readers' Digest</I> survey on kids' favorite sandwiches.  Peanut Butter & Jelly won hands down, but then there was the kid who said his favorite sandwich was his mother's pea soup...after it congealed in the refrigerator, he'd spread it on bread.

<H5>This national Dutch glory--also called <I>snert</I>--is prepared differently in every household--and traditionally it is made a day ahead.  Why?  To improve the flavor, but also to concentrate it to the preferred thickness; <I>viz.</I>, so that a spoon will stand upright in it.  This is a time when microwave reheats are ideal--no more burning the bottom of the pan trying to reheat such a thick paste.  I like the nutmeg in this recipe--it recalls the time when the Dutch had the Banda Island nutmeg trade sewn up in a monopoly.  It's traditional to serve the soup with slabs of bacon on pumpernickel bread.  Serve hot to 4-6 people as a hearty meal.

<LI>1/2 pound cooked <A HREF="fmeat.html">kielbasa</A> or other smoked sausage, sliced thin
</UL>
<P>
Parboil the pig's foot for 5 minutes, then drain, discarding liquid.  Bring the water to a boil in a large heavy pot, then add the peas, pig's foot, and ham hock.  When the water reboils, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook, partially covered, for 2 hours.  Stir it from time to time.
<P>
Stir in the rest of the ingredients (except the kielbasa) and simmer for 30 more minutes, stirring from time to time.  Remove the pig's foot and ham hock, cut away the meat, and return it to the pot with the sliced kielbasa.  Simmer for 10 minutes or so.
<P>
When ready to serve, reheat and ladle into bowls, with lots of thick bacon and bread on the side.
