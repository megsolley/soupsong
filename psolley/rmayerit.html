<CENTER><H2><I>Greek (and Cypriot) Easter Soup</I></H2><H4>(Mayeritsa)</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
<H5>This soup is traditional and ritualistic:  while a freshly slaughtered spring lamb is roasted for the main course of the Easter feast, this soup, which starts the meal, is supposed to be made out of the remaining parts--the lungs, liver, heart, and intestines cook in a broth made from the lamb's head.  Well, this recipe just isn't that pure.  On the other hand, it really is lovely--like a savory rice pudding with little bits of lamb and parsley and a lemony tang.  Just ignore the fact that you're using cornstarch to approximate the thickening you would have gotten from the entrails.  This is a soup that is all about the joy of redemption, the richness of Christian living in Mediterranean communities, and just plain good eating.  Serve hot to 4-6 people.  It's also wonderful reheated--so long as you reheat carefully and don't curdle it.</H5>

Cut the lamb off the bone and chop it coarsely.  Put the meat, the bones, the onion, and the celery into a large saucepan and cover with the water.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer.  Skim any froth and discard.  Cover the pot and cook for about an hour.
<P>
Stir in the rice and the parsley, cover, and cook for about 25 more minutes, til the rice is very tender.  Remove bones and discard.
<P>
When ready to serve, whisk the egg yolks, cornstarch, and milk together until smooth, then whisk it slowly into the soup.  Let the soup cook, uncovered, for about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat, stir in the lemon juice, season with salt and pepper to taste, then ladle into bowls and serve immediately.
