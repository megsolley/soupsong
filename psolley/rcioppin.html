<H5>This wonderful American fish stew hails from California, originally made by Italian-American (and some say Portuguese) fisherman along San Francisco's coast.  In any case, <I>Cioppino</I> means "fish stew" in Genoese dialect.  As with most fishermen stews, the ingredients aren't cast in stone--but rather a result of the day's cast.  It's hard to beat James Beard's version in his <I>New Fish Cookery</I>, though you can certainly cut back on--or substitute for--the extravagance of seafood he recommends and still have a feast.   Serve hot as a meal to 6-8, heavy on the red wine and garlic bread.</H5>

<P>
Start by soaking the mushrooms in cold water, then prepare the seafood.  Cut the raw fish in serving-sized pieces.  Shell and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails intact.  Clean and steam the mussels or clams in a quart of water or stock for about 4-5 minutes (until the shells open) and save the liquid.  Break the crab apart or cut the lobster in pieces.
<P>
Make the sauce.  Heat the olive oil in a saucepan, then saute the onion, garlic, mushrooms, and green pepper and cook for 3 minutes.  Add the tomatoes and cook down for a minute or two, then add the tomato paste, the wine, and 4 cups of the mussel or clam broth.  Salt and pepper to taste, cover, and let simmer for 30 minutes.
<P>
When ready to assemble, arrange the seafood in a large kettle:  first the crab or lobster, then the fish, topped by the shrimp.  Bring the sauce to a boil, then pour into the kettle, cover, and cook on low heat for 8 minutes. Toss in the mussels or clams (to reduce shell volume, you can wrench off and throw away half the shell before tossing in), cover, and heat for 2 more minutes.
<P>
Bring the kettle to the table and ladle out.  Make sure everyone has big towels and nutcrackers and picks--it's a gloriously messy meal.
