Persian cuisine--based largely on its ancient foundation of indigenous spinach, pomegranate, citrus fruits, saffron, and rosewater that grew there--features three basic types of soup:
<UL>
<LI><I>Ab goosht</I>:  an everyday, economical soup, meat based but filled with beans so it can be stretched to feed many.  Commonly, it uses lamb stock and can contain fruits, fruit juices, and grains.  
<LI><I>Ash</I>:  a vegetable-based soup (that can contain meat, vegetables, grains, and fruits).  A popular Ash uses rice, spinach, peas, lentils, and lemon juice.  The famous Ash-e Reshteh is filled with beans, spinach, noodles, yoghurt, and mint.
<LI><I>Soupe</I>:  a thin, often exotic soup used as a first course to stimulate the appetite and often accompanied with or thickened by <I>taftun</I>, a medium soft bread.
</UL>
Characteristically, all types of soup widely use fresh herbs and fruit--are often sweet/sour--and feature yoghurt.
