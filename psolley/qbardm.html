<U>Henry IV, part 1, II, 4</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF :       I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
        and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
        Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
        beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
        land now as cheap as stinking <A HREF="ffish.html">mackerel</A>.

<U>King Lear, III, 2</U>:<BR>
FOOL:    This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
        I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
        When priests are more in word than matter;
        When brewers mar their <A HREF="fbarley.html">malt</A> with water;
        When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
        No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
        When every case in law is right;
        No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
        When slanders do not live in tongues;
        Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
        When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
        And bawds and whores do churches build;
        Then shall the realm of Albion
        Come to great confusion:
        Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
        That going shall be used with feet.
        This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

<U>All's Well That Ends Well, IV, 5</U>:<BR>
CLOWN:     Indeed, sir, she was the <A HREF="fmarjora.html">sweet marjoram</A> of the
        salad, or rather, the <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">herb</A> of grace.
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
PERDITA:   I'll not put
        The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
        No more than were I painted I would wish
        This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
        Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
        Hot <A HREF="bflavor.html">lavender</A>, <A HREF="fmint.html">mints</A>, <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">savoury</A>, <A HREF="fmarjora.html">marjoram</A>;
        The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
        And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
        Of middle summer, and I think they are given
        To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
<P>
<U>King Lear, IV, 6</U>:<BR>
LEAR (blind and mad):  Nature's above art in that respect.  There's your press money.  That fellow handles his bow like a crowkeeper, draw me a clothier's yard.  Look, look, a mouse!  Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do't.  There's my gauntlet, I'll prove it on a giant.  Bring uup the brown bills.  Oh, well-flown bird! I' the clout, i' the clout. Hewgh! Give the word.<BR>
EDGAR:   <A HREF="fmarjora.html">Sweet marjoram.</A>
<P>
<U>Sonnet 99</U>
The forward violet thus did I chide:
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
The lily I condemned for thy hand,
And buds of <A HREF="fmarjora.html">marjoram</A> had stol'n thy hair.

<H3>Medlar</H3>
<HR>
<U>As You Like It, III, 2</U>:<BR>
ROSALIND:        I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
        with a <A HREF="fmedlar.html">medlar</A>: then it will be the earliest fruit
        i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
        ripe, and that's the right virtue of the <A HREF="fmedlar.html">medlar</A>.
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, II, 1</U>:<BR>
MERCUTIO:        If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
        Now will he sit under a <A HREF="fmedlar.html">medlar</A> tree,
        And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
        As maids call <A HREF="fmedlar.html">medlars</A>, when they laugh alone.
<P>
<U>Timon of Athens, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
TIMON:  ...Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?<BR>
APEMANTUS:  Where my stomach finds meat, or, rather, where I eat it.<BR>
TIMON:  Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!<BR>
APEMANTUS:  Where wouldst thou send it?<BR>
TIMON:  To sauce thy dishes.<BR>
APEMANTUS:  The middle of Humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends.  When thou wast in thy Gilt, and thy Perfume, they mockt thee for too much Curiosity:  in thy Rags thou know'st none, but art despis'd for the contrary.  There's a <A HREF="fmedlar.html">medlar</A> for thee, eat it.<BR>
TIMON:  On what I hate, I feed not.<BR>
APEMANTUS:  Do'st hate a <A HREF="fmedlar.html">Medlar</A>?<BR>
TIMON:  Ay, though it look like thee.<BR>
APEMANTUS:  And th'hadst hated Meddlers sooner, y' should'st have loved thy self better now.  What man didd'st thou ever know unthrift, that was beloved after his means!

<U>Henry IV, part 1, II, 3</U>:<BR>
What a pagan rascal is this! an
        infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
        of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
        open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
        and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
        <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">skim milk</A> with so honourable an action! Hang him!
        let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
        forward to-night.
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 2</U>:<BR>
PRINCESS:        Honey, and <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">milk</A>, and sugar; there is three.
<P>
<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, II, 1</U>:<BR>
Fairy   Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
        Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
        Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
        That frights the maidens of the villagery;
        Skim <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">milk</A>, and sometimes labour in the quern
        And bootless make the breathless housewife churn
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 4</U>:
PERDITA:   Even here undone!
        I was not much afeard; for once or twice
        I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
        The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
        Hides not his visage from our cottage but
        Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
        I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
        Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
        Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
        But <A HREF="fcheese.html">milk my ewes</A> and weep.
<P>
<U>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, I, 5</U>:<BR>
GHOST:  ...Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
        With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
        And in the porches of my ears did pour
        The leperous distilment; whose effect
        Holds such an enmity with blood of man
        That swift as quicksilver it courses through
        The natural gates and alleys of the body,
        And with a sudden vigour <A HREF="fcheese.html">doth posset
        And curd, like eager droppings into milk</A>,
        The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
        And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
        Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
        All my smooth body.
        Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
        Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd
<P>
<U>King Lear, I, 1</U>:<BR>
LEAR (to Cordelia):  ...Now, our joy,
        Although the last, not least; to whose young love
        The vines of France and <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">milk</A> of Burgundy
        Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
        A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

VOLUMNIA:             I prithee now, my son,
        Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
        And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
        Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
        Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
        More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
        Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
        Now humble as the ripest <A HREF="fberry.html">mulberry</A>

<U>The Tempest, V, 1</U>:<BR>
PROSPERO :       Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
        And ye that on the sands with printless foot
        Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
        When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
        By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
        Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
        Is to make midnight <A HREF="fmushroo.html">mushrooms</A>, that rejoice
        To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
        Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
        The noontide sun....But this rough magic
        I here abjure, and, when I have required
        Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
        To work mine end upon their senses that
        This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
        Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
        And deeper than did ever plummet sound
        I'll drown my book.

GRUMIO  Ay, but the <A HREF="fmustard.html">mustard</A> is too hot a little.<BR>
KATHARINE:      Why then, the <A HREF="fmeat.html">beef</A>, and let the <A HREF="fmustard.html">mustard</A> rest.<BR>
GRUMIO  Nay then, I will not: you shall have the <A HREF="fmustard.html">mustard</A>,
