<H5>Absolutely, outrageously rich--an unabashed decadent in the land of soup.  Perfect for those days when you've just got to be bad.  It was contributed by Amy Halsted, partner in <A HREF="http://www.rivermyst.net">Rivermyst Fly Fishing</A>, which specializes in fly fishing for women and families, and owner/creative director of The Halsted Agency, a marketing communications firm specializing in outdoor industries. Serve hot as an elegant first course to 4 to 6 people. </H5>

Saute the shallots, onion, and chili pepper in the butter over low heat in a large soup pot.  When the onions are transparent, stir in the flour and continue stirring, over medium heat, for about 2 minutes.  Be careful not to brown the flour.  Take off the heat and whisk in the cream and stock.  Return to heat and stir until thickened.  Stir in the crab gently (you don't want to break it up), then season with salt and pepper and Worcestershire sauce.  Cook at a very low heat for 20-25 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into bowls, stir a spoonful of sherry into each, and sprinkle with paprika.
