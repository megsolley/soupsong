<HR>
<H5>This unusual soup is based on the traditional Latin one-meal dish that customarily stuffs tacos, tamales, empanadas, and poblano peppers--traditionally is served at Mexican weddings--and now is being used in the southwestern United States to stuff Thanksgiving turkeys.  It's definitely a waker-upper as a soup, best served in small portions as an appetite stimulant.  Serve hot to 6 people as a first course.    </H5>
