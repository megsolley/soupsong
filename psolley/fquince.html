The fruit of this shrub of the rose family, native to Persia and Turkestan, has been cultivated since ancient times--and was easily naturalized in the Mediterranean area. The ancients dedicated quince to Aphrodite, and they were spread by Roman soldiers throughout the empire as a favored crop.  In 812, Charlemagne himself exhorted the French to grow more of them.  Chaucer, in medieval England, refers to them as <I>coines</I>, the French name.  <P>

Turner):<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Last night in the light rain as rough winds blew,<BR>My drunken sleep left me no merrier.<BR>I question one that raised the curtain, who<BR>Replies:  "The wild quince trees--are as they were."<BR>But no, but no!<BR>
Their rose is waning and their green leaves grow.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
