"It is best served over a ladle of rice in a bowl with marinated salad added as a garnish on top.  Truly wonderful!"<BR>-- Ion Mitchell, Great Britain
<P>
The best soup in the world! Ask the Egyptians. Your recipe needs a lot of improvements.  It is best made from fresh leaves. Second best, from frozen leaves imported from Egypt. Much better than lamb is meat and/or chicken or rabbit.  The garlic should be fried WITH
the ground coriander in butter or canola
(as the olive oil would be too strong),  One cannot substitute MELOKHIA leaves for any other green leaves !!! <BR>--Raymonde Harrouche, United States

<HR>
<H5>Portrayed in Pharonic tomb paintings and still the staple of the Egyptian people, this soup is probably for curiosity seekers only.  <I>Melokhia</I> is a member of the mallow family, and it cooks up into something pretty slimy that, to a non-cognoscenti, looks a lot like the dark green of pond scum.  Worse, what you thought would be the saving grace of the cayenne only serves to give you a nasty bite in the back of the throat once you get a mouthful down--and you're left, dazed, with bad breath.  As you can tell, not my favorite--and I'm not alone.  The 11th century Caliph Al-Hakim once banned it because he thought it was so awful. I was able to find the dried <I>melokhia</I> leaves at a local market.  Maybe I should have tried alternatives with fresh spinach, chard, or beet greens mixed with parsley.  Anyway, here it is for you brave ones out there.  Serve hot to 4-6 people, if they like it.

Boil the meat, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in 6 cups of water--skimming, then simmering for 2 hours.  Remove the meat, chop fine, and reserve.  Strain the stock.
<P>
Bring the stock back to a boil.  Crush the leaves between your hands into the stock, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes.
<P>
Meanwhile, crush the remaining garlic with some salt, then fry it in the oil until it is golden.  Stir in the coriander and cayenne.  Set aside until the leaves are cooked.
<P>
When ready to serve, return the meat to the pot, stir in the spices, and let simmer for a few minutes.  Ladle into bowls and serve immediately--and pass the onions soaked in vinegar on the side.
