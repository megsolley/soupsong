<HR>
<H5>This traditional soup of Nicaraguans--who prefer red beans to black--is both unusual and delightful.  the red bean puree is light and smooth, contrasting with the crisp onion, chunky red pepper, and bursts of intense pork from the <I>chicharrones</I> (pork rinds).  The poached egg on top enriches the soup and looks glorious--a yellow sun on a clay earth terrain.  Serve hot as a meal to 4 people. </H5>

Discard the soaking water and put the beans and garlic into a Dutch oven with the 8 cups of water. (You don't want a narrow pot, because you're going to poach 4 eggs in it at the end.)  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until soft, about an hour.  Pur&#233;e and return to the pot.
<P>
Saut&#233; the onions in the corn oil over medium heat until lightly crisp. Add the pork rinds, red pepper, and black pepper, and stir for a few minutes.  Scrape everything into the soup pot, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 5 minutes.  Season with salt.
<P>
When ready to serve, raise the heat to medium.  Carefully break the 4 eggs into different spots of the pot, cover, and let poach for several minutes.  Carefully ladle into bowls and serve immediately.
