<H5>This Italian soup is hearty and thick in texture, yet light and elusive in taste.  Without the radish garnish, I don't think anyone would guess--or believe--that you're feeding them the green stuff that's attached to radishes.  It's a delicious and fairly bland soup that makes a great lunch with a sandwich...and a nice first course to a rustic meal.  Serve hot to 4 people. </H5>

In a large saucepan, saute the leeks in the olive oil over medium heat for a few minutes.  Add a Tablespoon or so of water and cook for 4-5 more minutes, til the onions are tender.  Stir in the potatoes and radishes and toss over medium heat for a few minutes.  Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.  Add the radish greens and simmer for 10 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, puree the soup lightly, solids first, so that there's still a texture to it.  Return to the saucepan, stir in the butter and cheese, then ladle into bowls and top with a sprinkling of marinated minced radish.
