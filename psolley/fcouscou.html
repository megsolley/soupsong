<I>"It seems that the word couscous is a Gallic version of "rac keskes," which means "crushed small"</I><BR>--Leon Isnard

<I>"A handful of couscous is better than Mecca and all its dust"</I><BR>--Moroccan proverb, cited by E. Westermarch, meaning that charity at home is more pleasing to Allah than going on a <I>hadj</I>

This superb and cranky grain-pellet can be made out of just about anything:  green wheat, barley, corn, millet, crushed rice, even sprouts.  But it's best known and loved as a product of buckwheat semolina.
<P>
Stories abound as to the derivation of its name.  Yes, maybe <I>rac keskes</I>.  But then there's the story about it coming from the French <I>becquetee</I>, or "pecked at"--meaning that it's like the food a bird takes in its bill and rolls into pellets to feed to its young.  And others say it's onomatopoetic, the sound of it cooking in the special <I>couscousiere</I> pot, where the steam of the lower pot squeaks through the holes of the top pot holding the grain.  This last needs a good imagination, to my mind.
<P>
Properly made, this grain is fabulously tasty, with a nutty bite and texture.  But it <I>is</I> cranky, wadding up into a horrible and heavy ball if not steamed, handled, and oiled with dexterity.
<P>
Although "real" couscous can and should be bought to make classic North African couscous dishes; and although the "precooked" or "instant" versions sold in boxes in the supermarket are really pretty bad--I nevertheless recommend these latter to make soup.  MUCH easier, MUCH faster, and very very good.
