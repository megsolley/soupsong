<HR>
<H5>Wonderfully fresh and Italian, this hot soup for 4-6 practically comes with cows mooing and chickens scratching, it's that redolent of the countryside.  Chunky, filling, and unusually textured, it's a meal in itself.</H5>

<P>
Saute onions, garlic, and celery in the oil over medium-low heat in a large 
saucepan, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are golden (about 20 minutes).  Add the tomatoes and salt.  Cook on medium, partially covered, until the tomatoes are softened--about 20 minutes.  If you think it needs it, add a pinch of sugar to balance acidity.
<P>
Tear the bread into pieces in a small bowl and pour in 1 cup of the hot broth.  Let it absorb and soften--then  mash it with a wooden spoon and scrape into the tomatoes.  Pour in the rest of the stock and bring to a boil, stirring well to completely dissolve the bread.  Turn the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.  
<P>
Add the herbs and simmer for 5-10 minutes. Season to taste.  
<P>
When ready to serve, ladle into soup bowls  Garnish with shredded basil leaves and pour 1/2 teaspoon olive oil over each serving.
