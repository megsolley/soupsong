The easiest way to skin the chiles is to broil them close to the heating element, turning with tongs, til they're charred all over--then sticking them in a plastic bag for a couple minutes.  When they're skinned, cut off the tops and scrape away all the seeds.  Then chop finely.
<P>
Puree the chiles, avocados, and tomatillos in a blender, adding the water as needed to make into a smooth paste.  Then add the remaining water, lime juice, salt, and pepper.  Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and sprinkle with the reserved avocado chunks.
