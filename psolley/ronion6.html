<HR>
<H5>Dark and with the rich taste of a demi-glace, this sweet-sour and intensely onion soup lingers on the tongue like a fine wine.  Its flavor is really too assertive for a first course, but it makes an excellent lunch with half a sandwich, or a dinner with crusty bread, salad, and the rest of that red wine. Many thanks  to "Anon." for sending in this superb recipe.  Serve hot to 4-6 people.   </H5>

In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil, then stir in the onions--and there are LOTS of them.  Saut&#233;, stirring frequently, until the onions are completely wilted and turning nicely brown, almost like an onion marmalade.  This takes a long time, some 20 minutes or so, and they will cook down a lot.  Stir in the vinegar, and cook it down until it is mostly evaporated.  This is key--you don't want to add the wine until the vinegar is really cooked down.  Stir in the wine, and let cook it down quite a bit.  Finally, stir in the beef stock and chicken stock and bring to a boil.  Add the celery bundle, salt, and pepper, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes or so, to mix flavors.

When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top with very finely minced parsley.
