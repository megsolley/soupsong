<HR>
<H5>This savory soup is just scrumptious, especially with the unexpected counterpoint of its cool, tart garnish. Easy and fast to make, it's a perfect lunch or light supper on a raw, wet day...very much like a rich and filling tart, but more so.  Serve hot to 4 people.</H5>

<I>Garnish:</I> Mix 4 Tablespoons of <A HREF="bflavor.html">horseradish</A> and a finely chopped <A HREF="bflavor.html">gherkin pickle</A> into 4 Tablespoons of <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">sour cream</A> and chill.

<P>
Melt butter in a large saucepan, then saute the leeks and mushrooms--cooking gently for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time.  Add the vegetable stock, milk, and potatoes, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.  
<P>
When ready to serve, crumble in the Stilton cheese and stir well for a minute or two.  Ladle into bowls.  Top each serving with a heaping spoonful of the pickle-horseradish cream and a fine mince of parsley.
