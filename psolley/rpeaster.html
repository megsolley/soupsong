<HR>
<H5>This authentic Polish soup was handed down to Deanna Wilson of Gilbert, Arizona, from her great, great grandparents who lived in Warsaw. Deanna only makes it once a year--for Easter.  It is certainly wonderful in terms of using up those myriad hard boiled eggs!  Serve hot to Easter guests and to family for the days following.</H5>
