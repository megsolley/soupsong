"I cannot understand why people eat so much.  I? I do not like to eat.  No.  For me, sometimes a little soup and bread."

<H5>Here is the soup Maestro insisted on eating before conducting a concert.  Why?  Because it warmed and soothed him--just enough and not too much to sustain a superhuman effort.  And it works, especially when you make it a tradition.  Serve hot to yourself--better, have someone else lovingly serve it to you, someone who truly understands your <I>right</I> to be tempermental....</H5>

<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery</A>, finely chopped
<LI>2 Tablespoons <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>

<P>
Saute the celery in butter in a saucepan over a low heat, until it is tender.  Add the rice, stir to coat with the butter, then pour in the stock.  Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes.
<P>
When ready to serve, pour into a bowl, sprinkle with parsley, and put hot toast points on the side.
