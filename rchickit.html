<BLOCKQUOTE><H5>An illustrative story from Sharon of Live Oak, California:  This is a sad tale of a rooster who was
just doing his song in the predawn hours
last week under our neighbor's bedroom
window. The neighbor not especially in
good humor at that hour, reached over,
took his shotgun in hand, leaned out his
bedroom window and sent that bird to a
quick and merciful end.  My husband
asked for the rooster, remembering his
Italian grandmother's recipe for rooster
soup.  The plucked rooster simmered for
several hours in stock with vegetable.
Upon completion, the rooster was discarded, noodles were added and finishing
touches of seasoning completed the soup.
A little sprinkle of parmagiano if
desired.  Even a dead rooster can be
worthy.</H5></BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>*PESTO:</I>  You can buy this in most supermarkets--it lasts a long time in the refrigerator, longer if you freeze it and chip it out as needed.  To make from scratch, put a cup of fresh <A HREF="fbasil.html">basil leaves</A> in a blender or processor with 1/2 cup <A HREF="fnuts.html">pine nuts or walnuts</A>, 2 cloves of peeled <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, and 3/4 cup of grated <A HREF="fcheese.html">Parmesan cheese</A>.  Process til it's thoroughly mixed, then gradually pour in 1/2 cup of <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A> til it's thick and completely pureed.
