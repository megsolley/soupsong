<HR>
<H5>I'd been looking for this soup for years, since it was served to me as a Turkish soup by a USIA officer in Casablanca, Morocco.  No wonder I couldn't find it--it's Georgian, but with the Turkish touch of pasta.  In any case, it's wonderful--thick in texture, but light going down.  Distinctive and unusual, but not at all a curiosity.  If you're enthusiastic, see Darra Goldstein's book <I>The Georgian Feast</I> (1993), from which I adapted this recipe.  Serve the soup Georgian style, putting it on the table with all the other dishes, all at once--or serve as a substantial first course  to a light meal.  With lots of bread, it can be a meal in itself. Serve hot to 6 people.  </H5>

In a large pot, saute the onions in 3 Tablespoons butter until golden.  Meantime, grind the walnuts fine (works well in a blender), and pound the garlic, coriander, salt, and pepper into a paste.
<P>
When the onions are done, stir in the paste and the walnuts--and stir around for a minute.  Then pour in the tomato juice/water mix and stir in the soup noodles.  Bring to a simmer, cover, and let simmer for 20 minutes.
<P>
In a separate pot, cook the chopped tomatoes over low heat to soften them.

Add the tomatoes to the soup and simmer for 5 minutes--then stir in the chopped herbs and Tablespoon of butter.  Let simmer for a few minutes, then serve.
