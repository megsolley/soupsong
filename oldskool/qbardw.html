<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, I, 1</U>:<BR>
PAGE:    I am glad to see your worships well.
        I thank you for my <A HREF="fmeat.html">venison</A>, Master Shallow.
<BR>
SHALLOW:  Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
        your good heart! I wished your <A HREF="fmeat.html">venison </A>better; it
        was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I
        thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.
<BR>
PAGE:    Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">hot venison pasty</A> to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
        we shall drink down all unkindness.
<P>
<U>As You Like It, II, 1</U>:<BR>
DUKE SENIOR:     Come, shall we go and kill us <A HREF="fmeat.html">venison</A>?
        And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
        Being native burghers of this desert city,
        Should in their own confines with forked heads
        Have their round haunches gored.
<P>
<U>Cymbeline, III, 3</U>:<BR>
BELARIUS:        My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
        But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
        Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
        I was confederate with the Romans: so
        Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
        This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
        Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
        More pious debts to heaven than in all
        The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
        This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
        The <A HREF="fmeat.html">venison </A>first shall be the lord o' the feast;
        To him the other two shall minister;
        And we will fear no poison, which attends
        In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys....

IRIS:    Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
        Of <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat</A>, <A HREF="bthicken.html">rye</A>, <A HREF="fbarley.html">barley</A>, <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">vetches</A>, <A HREF="bthicken.html">oats</A> and <A HREF="fpeas.html">pease</A>;
        Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
        And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
        Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
        Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
        To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
        Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
        Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
        And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
        Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
        Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
        Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
        Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
        To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
        Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

<U>The Merchant of Venice, I, 1</U>:<BR>
SALARINO:        Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
        Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
        For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
        Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
        Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
        Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
        And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
        And other of such <A HREF="bflavor.html">vinegar</A> aspect
        That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
        Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, III, 4</U>:<BR>
SIR ANDREW :     Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
        <A HREF="bflavor.html">vinegar</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A> in't.

PETRUCHIO:       Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
        A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
        Why, 'tis a <A HREF="fscallop.html">cockle</A> or a <A HREF="fnuts.html">walnut-shell</A>,
        A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
        Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
FORD :   Help to search my house this one time. If I find
        not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
        me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
        me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
        <A HREF="fnuts.html">walnut</A> for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
        once more search with me.

DAVY:    Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:
        and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat</A>?<BR>
SHALLOW With <A HREF="bthicken.html">red wheat</A>, Davy. But for William cook: are

<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, I, 1</U>:<BR>
HELENA  Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
        Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
        Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
        More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
        When <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat</A> is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
        Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
        Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
        My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
        My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
        Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
        The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
        O, teach me how you look, and with what art
        You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
<P>
<U>The Merchant of Venice, I, 1</U>:<BR>
BASSANIO:        Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
        than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as <A HREF="bthicken.html">two
        grains of wheat</A> hid in two bushels of chaff: you
        shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
        have them, they are not worth the search.
<P>
<U>Troilus and Cressida, I, 1</U>:<BR>
PANDARUS:        Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
        I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
        have a cake out of the <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat </A>must needs tarry the grinding.

<U>King Lear, III, 4</U>:<BR>
EDGAR   This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
        at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
        the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
        hare-lip; mildews the <A HREF="bthicken.html">white wheat</A>, and hurts the
        poor creature of earth.
<P>
<U>Antony and Cleopatra, II, 6</U>:<BR>
POMPEY:   You have made me offer
        Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
        Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
        Measures of <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat</A> to Rome; this 'greed upon
        To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
        Our targes undinted.

<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 2</U>:<BR>
ROSALINE :       Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
        Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
        Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
        Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
        Which you on all estates will execute
        That lie within the mercy of your wit.
        To weed this <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">wormwood</A> from your fruitful brain,
        And therewithal to win me, if you please,
        Without the which I am not to be won,
        You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
        Visit the speechless sick and still converse
        With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
        With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
        To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, I, 3</U>:<BR>
NURSE:   Even or odd, of all days in the year,
        Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
        Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
        Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
        She was too good for me: but, as I said,
        On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
        That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
        'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
        And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
        Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
        For I had then laid <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">wormwood</A> to my dug,
        Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
        My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
        Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
        When it did taste the <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">wormwood</A> on the nipple
        Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
        To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
<P>
<U>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, III, 2</U>:<BR>

HAMLET  [Aside]  <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">Wormwood, wormwood.</A>
<P>
<U>The Rape of Lucrece, stanza 128</U>:<BR>
'Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,
Thy private feasting to a public fast,
Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,
Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter <A HREF="bflavor.html#herbs">wormwood</A> taste:
Thy violent vanities can never last.
How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?

BIRON:   Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
        <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">Metheglin</A>, <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">wort</A>, and <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">malmsey</A>: well run, dice!
