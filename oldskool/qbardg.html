<U>Henry IV, part 1, III, 1</U>:<BR>
HOTSPUR:   I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
        With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
        Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
        And of a dragon and a finless fish,
        A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
        A couching lion and a ramping cat,
        And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
        As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
        He held me last night at least nine hours
        In reckoning up the several devils' names
        That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
        But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
        As a tired horse, a railing wife;
        Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
        With <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A> and <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A> in a windmill, far,
        Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
        In any summer-house in Christendom.
<P>
<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
BOTTOM:  ... And, most dear actors, eat no <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>
        nor <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
        do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
        comedy. No more words: away! go, away!
<P>
<U>Measure for Measure, III, 2</U>:<BR>
LUCIO:   ...The
        duke, I say to thee again, would eat <A HREF="fmeat.html">mutton</A> on
        Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
        he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
        bread and <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>: say that I said so. Farewell.
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
DORCAS:    Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>,
        To mend her kissing with!
<P>
<U>Coriolanus, IV, 6</U>:<BR>
MENENIUS:          You have made good work,
        You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
        on the voice of occupation and
        The breath of <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic-eaters</A>!

<U>Henry IV, part 1, II, 1</U>:<BR>
SECOND CARRIER:    I have a gammon of <A HREF="fmeat.html">bacon</A> and two razors of <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>,
        to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
<P>
<U>Henry V, III, 7</U>:<BR>
ORLEANS (obsequiously describing the Dauphin's horse):  He's the color of <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmeg</A>.<BR>
DAUPHIN:   And of the heat of the <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>. It is a beast for
        Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
        elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
        only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
        him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
        may call beasts.
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 1</U>:<BR>
COSTARD:  An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst have it to buy gingerbread.
<P>
<U>The Merchant of Venice, III, 1</U>:<BR>
SALANIO:  I would she [Rumor] were as lying a gossip in that as ever
        knapped [chewed] <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A> or made her neighbours believe she
        wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
        true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
        plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
        honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
        to keep his name company!--
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, II, 3</U>:<BR>
CLOWN:    Yes, by Saint Anne, and <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A> shall be hot i' the
        mouth too.
<P>
<U>Measure for Measure, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
POMPEY:    I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
        of profession: one would think it were Mistress
        Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
        customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
        for a commodity of brown paper and old <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>,
        ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
        five marks, ready money: marry, then <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A> was not
        much in request, for the old women were all dead.
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
CLOWN:     I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
        I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
        of sugar, five pound of <A HREF="bflavor.html">currants</A>, <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>,--what will
        this sister of mine do with <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>? But my father
        hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
        on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
        the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
        ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
        one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
        horn-pipes. I must have <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> to colour the warden
        pies; <A HREF="fmace.html">mace</A>; <A HREF="bflavor.html">dates</A>?--none, that's out of my note;
        <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmegs</A>, seven; a race or two of <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>, but that I
        may beg; four pound of <A HREF="fplum.html">prunes</A>, and as many of
        <A HREF="bflavor.html">raisins</A> o' the sun.
