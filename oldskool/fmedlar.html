The medlar tree, which is related to roses, is small and deciduous and grows wild in all the temperate regions of Europe.  Its apple-shaped brown fruit has been cultivated for centuries--and what a tart, acidic fruit it is.  Usually, it's left for harvesting until after the first frost, for mellowing, then it's stored until it is as ripe and soft as possible.
