<H5>According to British author T. A. Layton (1957), cheese was invented by accident:  
<P>
There was a merchant from Arabia, so the story goes, way back in the mists of history, who put his day's supply of milk into a pouch made of a sheep's stomach.  He hoisted himself upon his camel and clip-clopped over the desert.  The beast's ambling movement, the residual rennet of the sheep-stomach pouch, and the hot sun did the rest.  That evening, the first drink of whey quenched the nomad's thirst--and his hunger was satisfied by the curd.  Cheese was born.
<P>
And make that birthing over 5000 years ago.  
<P>
Jesse the Bethlehemite, father of David, didn't realize he was sending his son to kill Goliath when he told David on that fateful day: "Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers; also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand" (1 Samuel, 17:17).  
<P>
And how about Job?  With his oxen as asses slain; his sheep, his camels, and his servants; his 7 sons and his 3 daughters all dead; himself afflicted with sores "from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head"--Job at last complained.  After all, he apostrophized to God, "Didst thou not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese?" (Job 10:10).
<P>
Cheese was mankind's first and best fast food--and has come, over time, to be called the Food of the Gods.
<P>
For the purposes of soup, hard cheese is mostly and excellently used.  But some decadently wonderful soups have been made with softer cheeses.  And, after all, there's more to life than cheese IN soup.  How about cheese on the side with crusty bread?  Or cheese as a dessert AFTER a full meal of soup and other things?
<P>
For which reasons, we'll cover ALL of the best known natural cheeses here, classifying them by hardness and talking about some of them--because so many have wonderful stories behind them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>First a word on <A NAME="cheeseinsoup">cheese in soups</A>...from Harold McGee's On Food and Cooking...TREAT & HEAT GENTLY TO PREVENT GLOPPY MESSES!</i>  <p>
"The behavior of cheese when heated depends primarily on its proteins.  Beyond a certain temperature, the cassein will coagulate and separate from the fat and water into tough, stringy masses.  Hard, well-ripened cheeses can tolerate higher temperatures than soft cheeses because more of their protein has been broken down into small, less easily coagulated fragments.  The degraded protein of hard cheese is also more readily dispersed in a sauce.  On the other hand, the more water and fat a cheese contains, the more easily it can be blended into a liquid that is composed mainly of these two materials.  Once successfully made, a cheese sauce (or soup) must be treated gently; if over heated, the casein will separate into stringy or grainy masses, and the rest of the sauce will become thin and soupy."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>A DWARF STORY FROM SWISS FOLKLORE:<P>  <I>A trusty and hard-working goatherd, who, as is the custom with goatherds of today also, ate his midday meal quite early in the morning, was often terribly hungry in the afternoon and until he brought the goats home late in the evening.  One day a charitable dwarf presented thim with a small cheese, and charged him strictly never to eat it quite up.  Now no one could have been happier than our goatherd, who could satisfy his hunger with the cheese aas often as he wanted to, for it had the wonderful property of growing to its original size between one meal and the next.  But one day when the goatherd was more than usually hungry he forgot the dwarf's command and at the cheese right up.  There was not the tiniest crumb of it left over, and so it remained, for as there was nothing of it left, there was also nothing to grow.  For the rest of his days the goatherd had to go hungry, for he could never refrain from eating his midday meal early in the morning.  But he was not the only one to suffer for his disobedience; the punishment was visited also upon all his fellow-goatherds, down to our own day.  No goatherd has ever received such a gift of cheese again.</I>
<P>
<LI>OF SAINT PETER, WHO CRIED "ROASTED CHEESE!" (from the not very "PC" <I>100 Merry Tales</I>, or Shakespeare Jestbook of 1525):<P>There is written among the old stories the tale of how God made
 Saint Peter the gatekeeper of heaven. The good Lord, soon after His passion, allowed many men to come into the kingdom of Heaven who had done little to deserve such honor.
<P>
After that time, there was in Heaven a large group of Welshmen, whose babbling and boasting annoyed everybody else.  God then told Saint Peter that He was weary of these Welshmen and would be glad to have them out of Heaven.  Saint Peter replied, "Good Lord, I warrant you, it shall be done."
<P>
Saint Peter then went outside the Heavenly Gates, and cried out in a loud voice, "Cause bobe," which means "roasted  cheese," a delicacy of which Welshmen are very fond. They all ran out of Heaven at a brisk pace.  When Saint Peter saw the whole group outside, he suddenly re-entered Heaven and locked the gates, thus keeping all the Welshmen outside.
<P>
<I>By this tale you may see that man is not wide to set his mind too much on delicacies or worldly pleasure, for in this way he may lose his celestial and eternal joy. </I><BR></H5>
