Native to the Moluccas in Indonesia, this fibrous, branched seed covering literally wraps its fleshy orange arms around the nutmeg seed.  Both are borne by an evergreen tree, which thrives best near the sea and in a rich, moist soil.  Mace is either dried and sold as a spice...or made to yield an oil that is used in cosmetics and medicines.
<P>
Interestingly, its "oil of nutmeg" is a known hallucinogen...whose euphoric effects, unfortunately, become pronounced just about the time it fatally poisons you.
