<U>Romeo and Juliet, I,5:</U><BR> 
FIRST SERVINGMAN, preparing for the masked ball:  Good thou, save me a
piece of <A HREF="fnuts.html">marchpane</A>. Thanks to James Eimont for the citation.</U>
<P>
<U>Troilus and Cressida, V, 2</U>:<BR>
THERSITES:       Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
        croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
        Patroclus will give me any thing for the
        intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
        do more for an <A HREF="fnuts.html">almond</A> than he for a commodious drab.
        Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
        else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!

<U>Henry IV, part I, III, 3</U>:  <BR>
FALSTAFF:        Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
        action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
        skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
        gown; I am withered like an old <A HREF="fapple.html">apple-john</A>.
<P>
<U>Henry IV, part 2, V, 3</U>:<BR>
SHALLOW:   Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,
        we will eat a last year's <A HREF="fapple.html">pippin</A> of my own graffing,
        with a dish of caraways, and so forth: come,
        cousin Silence: and then to bed.
<P>
<U>Henry V, III, 7</U>:<BR>
ORLEANS:   Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a
        Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
        rotten <A HREF="fapple.html">apples</A>! You may as well say, that's a
        valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
<P>
<U>Henry VIII, V, 4</U>:<BR>
PORTER:    These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,
        and fight for bitten <A HREF="fapple.html">apples</A>; that no audience, but
        the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of
        Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.
<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, I, 1</U>:<BR>
HORTENSIO:       Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
       <A HREF="fapple.html"> apples</A>. 
<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
BIONDELLO  [Aside]:    As much as an <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A> doth an <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>,
        and all one.       

<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
PETRUCHIO:       Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
        O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
        What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
        What, up and down, carved like an <A HREF="fapple.html">apple-tart</A>?
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
HOLOFERNES:      The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
        as the <A HREF="fapple.html">pomewater</A>, who now hangeth like a jewel in
        the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
        and anon falleth like a <A HREF="fapple.html">crab</A> on the face of terra,
        the soil, the land, the earth.

<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 2</U>:<BR>
BIRON:           Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
        Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
        And laugh upon the <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A> of her eye?

<P>
<U>A Midsummer's Night Dream, III, 2</U>:
OBERON:     Flower of this purple dye,
        Hit with Cupid's archery,
        Sink in <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A> of his eye.

<P>
<U>The Merchant of Venice, I, 3</U>:
ANTONIO:   Mark you this, Bassanio,
        The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
        An evil soul producing holy witness
        Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
        A goodly <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A> rotten at the heart:
        O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, I, 5</U>:<BR>
MALVOLIO:        Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
        a boy; as a <A HREF="fpeas.html">squash is before 'tis a peascod</A>, or a
        cooling when 'tis almost an <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A>: 'tis with him
        in standing water, between boy and man.
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, V, 1</U>:<BR>
ANTONIO:   How have you made division of yourself?
        An <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A>, cleft in two, is not more twin
        Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, I, 2</U>:<BR>
SIR HUGH EVANS:   Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
        is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
        Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
        and require her to solicit your master's desires to
        Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
        make an end of my dinner; there's <A HREF="fapple.html">pippins</A> and <A HREF="fcheese.html">cheese</A> to come.

<P>
<U>The Tempest, II, 1</U>:<BR>
SEBASTIAN:       I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
        and give it his son for an <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A>.
<P>
<U>King Lear, I, 5</U>:<BR>
FOOL:    Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
        for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
        <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A>, yet I can tell what I can tell.
<P>
<U>Sonnet 93</U>:<BR>
 How like Eve's <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A> doth thy beauty grow,
  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!
<P>
<HR><H3>Apricot</H3>
<U>Richard II, III, 4 </U>:<BR>   
GARD:   Goe binde thou vp yond dangling <A HREF="fapricot.html">Apricocks</A>, Which like vnruly Children, make
their Syre Stoupe with oppression of their prodigall weight: Giue some supportance
to the bending twigges. Goe thou, and like an Executioner Cut off the heads of too
fast growing sprayes, That looke too loftie in our Common-wealth: All must be euen,
in our Gouernment. You thus imploy'd, I will goe root away The noysome Weedes, that
without profit sucke The Soyles fertilitie from wholesome flowers.
