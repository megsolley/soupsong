<U>Henry IV, part 1, II, 1</U>:<BR>
FIRST CARRIER (talking about Robin Ostler):   Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of <A HREF="bthicken.html">oats</A>
        rose; it was the death of him.
<P>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, III, 2</U>:<BR>
GRUMIO:    Ay, sir, they be ready: the <A HREF="bthicken.html">oats</A> have eaten the horses.
<P>
<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
BOTTOM:  Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
        dry <A HREF="bthicken.html">oats</A>. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
        of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
<P>
<U>The Tempest, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
IRIS:    Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
        Of <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat</A>, <A HREF="bthicken.html">rye</A>, <A HREF="fbarley.html">barley</A>, vetches, <A HREF="bthicken.html">oats</A> and pease;
        Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
        And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
        Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
        Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
        To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
        Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
        Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">vineyard</A>;
        And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
        Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
        Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
        Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
        Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
        To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
        Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
<P>
<U>King Lear, V, 3</U>:<BR>
Captain I cannot draw a cart, nor eat <A HREF="bthicken.html">dried oats</A>;
        If it be man's work, I'll do 't.
<P>

<U>The Comedy of Errors, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE:      Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
        That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
        And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
        I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
        The <A HREF="bflavor.html">oil</A>, the balsamum and <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">aqua-vitae</A>.
        The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
        Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
        But for their owner, master, and yourself.
<P>
<U>The Tempest, II, 1</U>:<BR>
GONZALO:   I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
        Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
        Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
        Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
        And use of service, none; contract, succession,
        Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
        No use of metal, <A HREF="bthicken.html">corn</A>, or <A HREF="bflavor.html#alcohol">wine</A>, or <A HREF="bflavor.html">oil</A>;
        No occupation; all men idle, all;
        And women too, but innocent and pure;
        No sovereignty;--

<U>Henry VI, part 3, IV, 6</U>:<BR>
CLARENCE:        No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
        To whom the heavens in thy nativity
        Adjudged an <A HREF="folive.html">olive branch</A> and <A HREF="fbay.html">laurel</A> crown,
        As likely to be blest in peace and war;
        And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
<P>
<U>Anthony and Cleopatra, IV, 6</U>:<BR>
OCTAVIUS CAESAR:  The time of universal peace is near:
        Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
        Shall bear the <A HREF="folive.html">olive</A> freely.
<P>
<U>Sonnet 107</U>:<BR>
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
Can yet the lease of my true love control,
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims <A HREF="folive.html">olives</A> of endless age.
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.

<U>The Taming of the Shrew, Prologue</U>:<BR>
And if the boy have not a woman's gift
        To rain a shower of commanded tears,
        An <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A> will do well for such a shift,
        Which in a napkin being close convey'd
        Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
<P>
<U>Anthony and Cleopatra, I, 2</U>:<BR>
ENOBARBUS:  ...indeed the tears live in an <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>
        that should water this sorrow.
<P>
ENOBARBUS:     What mean you, sir,
        To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
        And I, an ass, am <A HREF="fonion.html">onion-eyed</A>: for shame,
        Transform us not to women. (IV, 2)
<P>
<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
BOTTOM: ...And, most dear actors, eat no <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>
        nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
        do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
        comedy.
<P>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, V, 3</U>:<BR>
LAFEU:   Mine eyes smell <A HREF="fonion.html">onions</A>; I shall weep anon

<U>Much Ado About Nothing, II, 1</U>:<BR>
BEATRICE:        The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
        well; but civil count, civil as an <A HREF="fcitrus.html">orange</A>, and
        something of that jealous complexion.
<P>
CLAUDIO:   Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
        There, Leonato, take her back again:
        Give not this rotten <A HREF="fcitrus.html">orange</A> to your friend;
        She's but the sign and semblance of her honour. (IV, 1)
<P>

<H3>Oyster</H3>
<HR>
<U>The Taming of the Shrew, IV, 2</U>:<BR>
BIONDELLO  [Aside]:    As much as an <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A> doth an <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>,
        and all one.
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, II, 2</U>:<BR>
PISTOL:    Why, then the world's mine <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>.
        Which I with sword will open.
<P>
<U>Much Ado About Nothing, II, 3</U>:<BR>
BENEDICT:  May I be so converted and see with
        these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
        be sworn, but love may transform me to an <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>; but
        I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>
        of me, he shall never make me such a fool.
<P>
<U>As You Like It, V, 4</U>:<BR>
TOUCHSTONE:      God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
        press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
        copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
        marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
        sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
        humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
        will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
        poor house; as your pearl in your foul <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>.
<P>
<U>King Lear, I, 5</U>:<BR>
FOOL:   Canst tell how an <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A> makes his shell?
<P>
<U>Anthony and Cleopatra, I, 5</U>:<BR>
ALEXAS:    'Good friend,' quoth he,
        'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
        This treasure of an <A HREF="foyster.html">oyster</A>; at whose foot,
        To mend the petty present, I will piece
        Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
        Say thou, shall call her mistress.'
