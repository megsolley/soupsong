<I>"The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:  Which indeed is the least of all seeds:  but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."</I>

These yellow-flowered members of the cabbage family produce seeds that have been ground and used as a condiment for thousands of years.

White, black, or Indian, both seeds and leaves are pungent.  Black mustard greens (often a weed in the U.S.) has medical applications:  it's a valuable counter-irritant, either in liniment or plaster form (and I have strong memories of my grandmother applying these burning plasters to my chest to break up a cold); it's a stomach stimulant; and it's an emetic. 
<P>
And what about the leaves of this plant?  A wonderful leaf green, especially the <I>Brassica juncea</I> and <I>Brassica campestris</I> varietals.
