<U>The Taming of the Shrew, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
BIONDELLO:       I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
        afternoon as she went to the garden for <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A> to
        stuff a <A HREF="fmeat.html">rabbit</A>; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
        sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
        Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
        you come with your appendix.

<U>Much Ado About Nothing, II, 1</U>:<BR>
BEATRICE:        Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
        which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
        strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
        <A HREF="fmeat.html">partridge wing</A> saved, for the fool will eat no
        supper that night.

<U>Henry IV, part 1, II, 1</U>:<BR>
SECOND CARRIER:   <A HREF="fpeas.html">Peas</A> and <A HREF="fbeans.html">beans</A> are as dank here as a dog, and that
        is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
        house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
<P>
<U>A Midsummer Night's Dream, III, 1</U>:<BR>
A Midsummer Night's Dream

Act 3, Scene 1

BOTTOM:    I pray you, commend me to Mistress <A HREF="fpeas.html">Squash</A>, your
        mother, and to Master <A HREF="fpeas.html">Peascod</A>, your father. Good
        Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
        acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
<P>
BOTTOM:    I had rather have a handful or two of <A HREF="fpeas.html">dried peas</A>.
        But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
        have an exposition of sleep come upon me. (IV, 1)
<P>
<U>Love's Labour's Lost, V, 2</U>:<BR>
BEROWNE:   This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons <A HREF="fpeas.html">pease</A>,
        And utters it again when God doth please:
        He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
        At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs....
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, I, 5</U>:<BR>
MALVOLIO        Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
        a boy; as a <A HREF="fpeas.html">squash</A> is before 'tis a <A HREF="fpeas.html">peascod</A>, or a
        cooling when 'tis almost an <A HREF="fapple.html">apple</A>: 'tis with him
        in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
        well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
        would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
<P>
<U>The Tempest, IV, 1</U>:<BR>
IRIS    Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
        Of <A HREF="bthicken.html">wheat</A>, <A HREF="bthicken.html">rye</A>, <A HREF="fbarley.html">barley</A>, vetches, <A HREF="bthicken.html">oats</A> and <A HREF="fpeas.html">pease</A>;
        Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
        And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
        Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
        Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
        To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
        Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
        Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
        And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
        Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
        Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
        Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
        Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
        To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
        Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, IV, 5</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF:       I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
        been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
        the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
        and how my transformation hath been washed and
        cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
        drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
        they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
        as crest-fallen as a <A HREF="fpear.html">dried pear</A>.
<P>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, I, 1</U>:<BR>
PAROLLES:        Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
        likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
        lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
        while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
        Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
        of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
        like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
        now. Your <A HREF="bflavor.html">date</A> is better in your pie and your
        porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
        your old virginity, is like one of our <A HREF="fpear.html">French
        withered pears</A>, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
        'tis a <A HREF="fpear.html">withered pear</A>; it was formerly better;
        marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?

<U>King Henry IV, part 1, III, 1</U>:<BR>
HOTSPUR:  ... Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
        A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
        And such protest of <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A>-gingerbread,
        To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
        Come, sing.
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, III, 5</U>:
FORD:  ...I will now take the lecher; he is at my
        house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
        should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
        nor into a <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper-box</A>: but, lest the devil that
        guides him should aid him, I will search
        impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
        yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
        if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
        with me: I'll be horn-mad.
<P>
<U>Twelfth Night, III, 4</U>:<BR>
SIR ANDREW:     Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
       <A HREF="bflavor.html"> vinegar</A> and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A> in't.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Pheasant</H3>
<HR>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 4</U>:<BR>
CLOWN:   Advocate's the court-word for a <A HREF="fmeat.html">pheasant</A>: say you have none.<BR>
SHEPHERD:        None, sir; I have no <A HREF="fmeat.html">pheasant, cock nor hen.</A>
<P>

<H3>Pickle</H3>
<HR>
<U>Twelfth Night, I, 5</U>:<BR>
SIR TOBY BELCH:  'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
        <A HREF="ffish.html">pickle-herring</A>! How now, sot!
<P>
<U>Anthony and Cleopatra, II, 5</U>:<BR>
CLEOPATRA:       What say you? Hence, [Strikes him again] Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes  Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head: [She hales him up and down] Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
        Smarting in lingering <A HREF="bflavor.html">pickle</A>.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Pike</H3>
<HR>
<U>King Henry IV, part 2, III, 2</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF:  ...if the young <A HREF="ffish.html">dace</A> be a bait for the
        old <A HREF="ffish.html">pike</A>, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
        may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

<H3>Plums</H3>

<P>
<U>Henry VI, II, 1</U>:<BR>
CARDINAL:  What, art thou lame?<BR>
SIMPCOX:  Aye, God Almighty help me!<BR>
SUFFOLK:  How camest thou so?<BR>
SIMPCOX:  A fall off of a tree.<BR>
WIFE:  A <A HREF="fplum.html">plum tree</A>, master.<BR>
GLOUCESTER:  How long hast thou been blind?<BR>
SIMPCOX:  Oh, born so, master.<BR>
GLOUCESTER:  What, and wouldst climb a tree?
SIMPCOX:  But that in all my life, when I was a youth.<BR>
WIFE:  Too true, and bought his climbing very dear.<BR>
GLOUCESTER:  Mass, thou lovedst <A HREF="fplum.html">plums</A> well, that wouldst venture so.<BR>
SIMPCOX:  Alas, good master, my wife desired some <A HREF="fplum.html">damsons</A>, And made me climb, with danger of my life.
<P>
<U>King John, II, 1</U>:<BR>
CONSTANCE:       Do, child, go to it grandam, child:
        Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
        Give it a <A HREF="fplum.html">plum</A>, a <A HREF="fcherry.html">cherry</A>, and a <A HREF="ffig.html">fig</A>:
        There's a good grandam.
<P>
<U>Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, II, 2</U>:<BR>
HAMLET:  Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
        that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
        wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
        <A HREF="fplum.html">plum-tree gum</A> and that they have a plentiful lack of
        wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
        though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
        I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
        yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a <A HREF="fcrab.html">crab</A>
        you could go backward.
<P>
<U>Venus and Adonis, Stanza 86</U>:<BR>
'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:
Before I know myself, seek not to know me;
No fisher but the <A HREF="ffish.html">ungrown fry</A> forbears:
The mellow <A HREF="fplum.html">plum</A> doth fall, the green sticks fast,
Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.
<P>
<U>The Passionate Pilgrim, Stanza 10</U>:<BR>
Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck'd, soon vaded,
Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!
Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!
Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!
Like a <A HREF="fplum.html">green plum</A> that hangs upon a tree,
And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.
<P>
<HR>
<H3>Pomegranate</H3>
<HR>
<U>All's Well That Ends Well, II, 3</U>:<BR>
LAFEU:   Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
        kernel out of a <A HREF="fpomegra.html">pomegranate</A>; you are a vagabond and no true traveller
<P>
<U>Romeo and Juliet, III, 5</U>:<BR>
JULIET  Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
        It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
        That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
        Nightly she sings on yon <A HREF="fpomegra.html">pomegranate-tree</A>:
        Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

<U>Othello, The Moor of Venice, III, 3</U>:<BR>
IAGO:  ...        Not <A HREF="bflavor.html#spices">poppy</A>, nor <A HREF="bflavor.html#spices">mandragora</A>,
        Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
        Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
        Which thou owedst yesterday.

<H3>Pork</H3>
<HR>
<U>The Merchant of Venice, I, 3</U>:<BR>
SHYLOCK:   Yes, to smell <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork</A>; to eat of the habitation which
        your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
        will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
        walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
        with you, drink with you, nor pray with you....
<P>
LAUNCELOT:       Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
        enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
        another. This making Christians will raise the
        price of hogs: if we grow all to be <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork-eaters</A>, we
        shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money. (III, 5)
<P>
JESSICA:   Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
        are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
        me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
        says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
        for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
        price of <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork</A>. (III, 5)

<H3>Potato<BR>(sweet potato only--no white potatoes in England then)</H3>
<HR>
<U>Troilus and Cressida, V, 2</U>:<BR>
THERSITES:       How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
        <A HREF="fsweetpo.html">potato-finger</A>, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, V, 5</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF:       My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
        <A HREF="fsweetpo.html">potatoes</A>; let it thunder to the tune of Green
        Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
        there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.
<P>
<HR><H3>Prunes</H3>
<HR>
<U>King Henry IV, part 1, III, 3</U>:<BR>
FALSTAFF:      There's no more faith in thee than in a <A HREF="fplum.html">stewed
        prune</A>; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
        fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
        deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
        go....
<P>
<U>The Merry Wives of Windsor, I, 1</U>:<BR>
SLENDER:   I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
        my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
        dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
        dish of <A HREF="fplum.html">stewed prunes</A>; and, by my troth, I cannot
        abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
        dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
<P>
<U>Measure for Measure, II, 1</U>:<BR>
POMPEY:    Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
        saving your honour's reverence, for <A HREF="fplum.html">stewed prunes</A>;
        sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
        distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
        dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
        such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
        good dishes,--<BR>
ESCALUS:  Go to, go to.  No matter for the dish, sir.<BR>
POMPEY:   No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
        the right: but to the point. As I say, this
        Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
        being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
        <A HREF="fplum.html">prunes</A>; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
        Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
        rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
        honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
        not give you three-pence again.<BR>
ESCALUS:  No indeed.<BR>
POMPEY:  Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
        cracking the stones of the foresaid <A HREF="fplum.html">prunes</A>,--
<P>
<U>The Winter's Tale, IV, 3</U>:<BR>
CLOWN: ...I must have <A HREF="fsaffron.html">saffron</A> to colour the warden
        pies; <A HREF="fmace.html">mace</A>; <A HREF="bflavor.html">dates</A>?--none, that's out of my note;
        <A HREF="fnutmeg.html">nutmegs</A>, seven; a race or two of <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>, but that I
        may beg; four pound of <A HREF="fplum.html">prunes</A>, and as many of
        <A HREF="bflavor.html">raisins</A> o' the sun.
