Soak the barley overnight (or at least while you're boiling the bones).
<P>
Put the bones, onion, and peppercorns in a large pot and cover with the cold water.  Bring to a boil slowly, skimming the foam as it rises. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and let simmer for 2 hours.  Strain and skim off the fat.  Strip any good meat from the bones and add to the broth.
<P>
In a large souppot, bring the broth and meat to a boil, add the soaked (and strained) barley and all the vegetables.  When the pot is at a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for an hour, until the barley is tender.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.  When ready to serve, ladle into bowls and top each with a mince of parsley.
