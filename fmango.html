This luscious tropical fruit is a member of the cashew family, Anacardiaceae--an evergreen that grows some 70 feet high--and was first cultivated about 4,000 years ago in India and the Malay Archipelago.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, European explorers discovered them and transported them to places all over the tropical world, including Brazil and Mexico.

Consider this deliciously moody story from Bantu tribes in the Belgian Congo, collected by Virginia Holladay in the 1930s (New York: Viking Press):
<BLOCKQUOTE><H5><CENTER>THE MAN AND THE MANGO TREES</CENTER><P>
There was once a man who had a new house. He had built the
 house so that there was a mango tree on each side of the door. The
 man was very fond of mangoes and watched the trees carefully
 every day to see if the fruit had ripened. It happened that the fruit
 was ready to gather on both trees at the same time. On the tree to
 the right of the door, the fruit was yellow, with a tinge of pink on
 the sunny side. On the tree to the left, the fruit had a tinge of pink
 on a yellow background.
<P>
 When the man saw how good the fruit looked on both trees, he
 walked back and forth, trying to decide which he should eat first.
 Then he sat down on the doorstep to think it  over. The longer he
 sat, the less he could decide. He was so hungry for mangoes that
 he began to  cry. At last he cried himself to sleep.
<P>
 After a while a stranger came along and saw the man's face all
 swollen from crying. He woke him up and asked him what the
 matter was. After hearing about the mangoes, he said he thought
 that the fruit on the tree to the right looked best. Then he went
 on his way.
<P>
 As soon as the stranger was gone the man began to wonder if he
 should eat the best fruit first, or save it until last. That started him
crying again) and he forgot which fruit the stranger had said looked best.
<P>
 One by one the ripe mangoes fell.  When the stranger passed
that way again, the man was still sitting on the doorstep crying. All
 the mangoes had fallen to the ground and rotted.
