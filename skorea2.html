Koreans call themselves <I>t'angban minjok</I>, a rice and soup eating people--and with good reason.  Rice, soup (kuk/guk), and kimchee are traditionally served simultaneously at all meals, no matter how fancy or simple--breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even when many other side dishes are included, soup usually serves as the beverage, as tea is not generally served until the end of the meal.  
<P>
Soup stocks can be made of beef, chicken, fish, dried seafood, or seaweed--and they often start with the water the rice has been washed in.  
<P>
Special soups are served for festivals, whether national holidays, Confucian rituals, or special occasions.    For example: Ttok Manduguk (rice cake and dumpling soup) for New Years; red bean cereal soup for Dongi; kuk soo jang kuk (beef mushroom soup with long noodles) for marriage; miyokguk (seaweed soup) for brand new mothers; and okol kyesamt'ang (black rooster soup with some 20 ingredients) or kyesamt'ang (ginseng chicken soup) or paeksuk (plain chicken soup with sweet rice and garlic) for tonics.  
<P>
As with the rest of the Korean cuisine, these soups are any combination of <I>hanguk omsikun saek'om, dalk'om, malk'om hago olk'un, tchagvtchal, ssubssul, kkoshohan masida</I>--pleasantly sour, sweet, hot, burning hot, salty, bitter, and nutty.
