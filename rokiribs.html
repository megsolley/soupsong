<H5>Oh, it's just an amazing soup--a little Chinese...a little Japanese...quintessential Okinawan:  that is, short meaty white spareribs, brown spongy mushrooms, yellow-green seaweed, white radish, and bright green mustard cabbage. Smell it:  there's no mistaking the tang of ginger, but who could deconstruct that layered aroma of meat/seaweed/bonito fish/mushroom stock?  And all those classic Okinawan health benefits.  Pork (with all the fat boiled out of it) for protein. Mustard cabbage for regularity and a healthy stomach.  Seaweed, rich in iron, calcium, and iodine; moderating blood pressure; practically no calories.  I tell you, it's a fabulous soup.  This recipe is adapted from Hui O Laulima's <I>Okinawan Mixed Plate</I>--and what nice people they are there in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The graphic is by an astounding Okinawan artist.  Serve the soup hot to 6 as a substantial first course...or a light meal.</H5>

<UL>
<LI>8 dried <A HREF="fmushroo.html">shiitake mushrooms</A>, softened in 1 cup warm water and a pinch of sugar for 15 minutes, then quartered (discarding the stems and reserving the mushroom liquid)
<LI>2 strips of dried <A HREF="fseaweed.html">seaweed</A>, rehydrated in cold water for 5 minutes, then cut into 2-inch pieces (a little dried seaweed goes a long way--you want to end up with about 3/4 cup)
<LI>1/2 pound <A HREF="fcabbage.html">mustard cabbage</A>, trimmed, blanched in boiling water for 1 minute, then strained and rinsed in cold water.
<LI>1 and 1/2 pounds meaty <A HREF="fmeat.html">pork spareribs</A>, cut into 2-inch pieces, then put into a pot of cold water, heated to a rolling boil, drained, and rinsed
<LI>1 whole nodule of fresh, young <A HREF="fginger.html">ginger</A>, crushed but still in one piece for easy removal
<LI>4 cups water
<LI>1 small <A HREF="fdaikon.html">daikon radish</A>, peeled and cut into small cubes
<LI>2 cups <A HREF="bstock.html#dashi">dashi stock</A> (diluting 1 teaspoon of Hon-Dashi granules in 2 cups of boiling water)
<LI>3 Tablespoons <A HREF="fbeans.html#soy">soy sauce</A>
<LI>2 teaspoons <A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A>
</UL>
It's most efficient to prepare all the ingredients at the start--softening the mushrooms, rehydrating the seaweed, blanching the mustard cabbage, parboiling the ribs--and only then starting the soupmaking.
<P> 
Put the mushrooms, spareribs, and ginger in a large soup pot with the 4 cups of water.  Bring to a fast boil, skimming away any foam, then reduce heat to medium and let cook, partially covered, for 30 minutes.
<P>
Add the seaweed pieces, cubed daikon, dashi stock, and reserved mushroom liquid, bring back to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 more minutes, until the pork and daikon are tender.
<P> 
When ready to serve, remove the hunk of ginger, season to taste with soy sauce and salt, and stir in the mustard cabbage.  Bring the soup to a boil, then serve out into bowls.
