<HR>
An underground grower, blind and a common brown;<BR>
Got a misshapen look, it's nudged where it could;<BR>
Simple as soil yet crowded as earth with all.
<P>
Cut open raw, it looses a cool clean stench,<BR>
Mineral acid seeping from pores of prest meal;<BR>
It is like breaching a strangely refreshing tomb:
<P>
Therein the taste of first stones, the hands of dead slaves,<BR>
Waters men drank in the earliest frightful woods,<BR>
Flint chips, and peat, and the cinders of buried camps.
<P>
Scrubbed under faucet water the planet skin<BR>
Polishes yellow, but tears to the plain insides;<BR>
Parching, the white's blue-hearted like hungry hands.
<P>
All of the cold dark kitchens, and war-frozen gray<BR>
Evening at window; I remember so many<BR>
Peeling potatoes quietly into chipt pails.
<P>
"It was potatoes saved us, they kept us alive."<BR>
Then they had something to say akin to praise<BR>
For the mean earth-apples, too common to cherish or steal.
<P>
Times being hard, the Sikh and the Senegalese,<BR>
Hobo and Okie, the body of Jesus the Jew,<BR>
Vestigial virtues, are eaten; we shall survive.
<P>
What has not lost its savor shall hold us up,<BR>
And we are praising what saves us, what fills the need.<BR>
(Soon there'll be packets again, with Algerian fruits.)
<P>
Oh, it will not bear polish, the ancient potato,<BR>
Needn't be nourished by Caesars, will blow anywhere,<BR>
Hidden by nature, counted-on, stubborn and blind.
<P>
You may have noticed the bush that it pushes to air,<BR>
Comical-delicate, sometimes with second-rate flowers<BR>
Awkward and milky and beautiful only to hunger.
