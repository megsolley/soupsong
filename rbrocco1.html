<HR>
<H5>This hearty Tuscan soup is a superb blend of textures and flavors and colors--and is incredibly rich in protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.  Serve hot as a meal to 4, with lots of crusty bread. </H5>

<LI>1 Tablespoon of <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="folive.html">olive oil</A>
<LI>1 medium <A HREF="fonion.html">onion</A>, sliced into thin rings
<LI>2 medium <A HREF="fleek.html">leeks</A>, washed and sliced into rings through the white and light green parts
<LI>2 stalks <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery</A>, sliced (leaves too)
<LI>1 teaspoon <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, chopped
<LI>3/4 cup dried <A HREF="fbeans.html#white beans">cannellini (white) beans</A>, soaked for 6 hours and drained--or a large can (28 ounces) of them, drained
<LI>bouquet garni of 1 teaspoon <A HREF="fcilantr.html">coriander seeds</A>, 1/2 teaspoon <A HREF="fpiper.html">peppercorns</A>, <A HREF="fthyme.html">thyme</A>, <A HREF="fparsley.html">parsley</A>, and a <A HREF="fbay.html">bay leaf</A>--tied into a little cheesecloth or coffee filter and secured with string or a twistie
<LI>8 cups water
<LI>1/2 cup <A HREF="fmeat.html">prosciutto ham</A>, sliced paper thin and finely diced
<LI>4 cups <A HREF="fbroccol.html">broccoli florets</A>, cut into small bites
<LI>1 Tablespoon <A HREF="bflavor.html#vinegar">balsamic vinegar</A>
<LI>salt and <A HREF="fpiper.html">pepper</A> to taste
</UL>  
<P>
<I>Garnish:</I> freshly grated <A HREF="fcheese.html">Parmesan cheese</A>
<P>
If you are using <A HREF="fbeans.html">dried beans</A>, soak them for at least 6 hours.
<P>
To start the soup, saute onions, leeks, celery, and garlic in the butter and oil on medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Pour in the water and the drained beans, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and plunge in the bouquet garni of herbs.  Simmer for 2 hours (less if you are using drained, canned beans).  
<P>
When beans are completely tender, remove the bouquet garni, and season to taste.  You can leave at a low simmer at this point.
<P>
When ready to serve, stir in the prosciutto ham and the broccoli.  You don't want to do this earlier, because the broccoli will turn color.  Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the broccoli is just tender.  Stir in the balsamic vinegar and grind a little more fresh pepper into the soup.  Ladle into bowls and garnish with generous handfuls of fresh grated Parmesan cheese.
