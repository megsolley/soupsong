<I>I asked:  Tell me about your grandma.</I><BR>"Well, I have to say that I am not entirely sure about my grandma's history (except that she was German and Irish) as she passed away in 1985 (age 69) and I was only 19.  My aunts and uncles (eight of them altogether, counting my mom) are doing a "family tree" on my grandfather (who was part American Indian).  He passed away in 1998 at the age of 86.  My Grandma was a "stay at home mom" with her eight children and my Pop Pop was the provider for the family.  As you can probably guess, she had to make the meals go further for her family of 10 and stretch the dollar!  My Pop Pop worked very hard to keep all of the kids fed well and dressed.  As I have lived next door to my grandparents my entire life (with the exception of my young adult years), my Grandma was my life!  My parents both worked and my Grandma taught me how to crochet, cook, bake and decorate cakes and taught me a lot about life!  I still miss her almost 20 years later and named my daughter after her!  Being that I was born with spina bifida and have paralysis of my left leg, I spent many, many months in the hospital and my Grandma spent every night there with me if my Mom could not.  The most wonderful thing my Grandma ever said to me was when I was a teenager.  Being that I walk with crutches, I was quite worried how I would ever "fit in" and how other kids would see me (the usual teenager fears but my Grandma knew I was especially worried because of my walking with crutches).  She told me one day that "yes, you are different but you are also beautiful inside and out, and our differences are what make us beautiful."  Can you imagine?  That so eased my mind - even to this day.  Just that tiny little statement made me feel so good.  Thanks for asking me (because I don't get a chance to talk about her much anymore) about my Grandma.  She was the greatest person I have ever known."</H5>

<H5>This polyglot soup is a universal panacea--very similar to the classic French <I>bonne femme</I> or <A HREF="rpotato3.html">Parmentier soup</A>.  Tammy White's recipe, though, has a nice tooth and texture to it--and, as she says, is a great comfort food on wintery days.  Serve hot to your family or to a crowd.  In small portions, it's a nice start to a meal or adjunct to a sandwich.  In large portions, served with salad and bread, it's an excellent meal. </H5>

<I>Garnish:</I> Your fancy.  A sprinkle of <A HREF="fpaprika.html">paprika</A>.  Chopped <A HREF="fcelery.html">celery leaves</A> or <A HREF="fgronion.html">scallions</A>.  I put 2 paper thin slices of <A HREF="fpepper.html">cherry peppers</A> and a sprinkling of <A HREF="fgronion.html">scallion slices</A> over the soup in a white soup plate--looked like a work of art!
<P>
Put the cubed potatoes and onions in a saucepan or souppot, depending on the volume, and cover with water about 1/2-inch higher than the solids.  Bring to a boil, partially cover, then reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes are soft.  Drain off about half the water, then pour in enough milk to be about 1/2-inch higher than the solids.  Bring to a boil, simmer for 3-5 minutes, the stir in the butter.  Salt and pepper to taste (or, as Tammy suggests, let your family members and guests season the soup at the table).  Also, Tammy says, "Serve with low fat saltines!  Very easy and tasty, a great comfort food on wintery days...enjoy!"
