<H5>Wow--thickly tomato, piquant, lush with seafood, and with the soft bite of barley:  this is an excellent and hearty soup from America's west coast.  Many thanks to Reiko Callner of Olympia, Washington, for contributing the recipe.  She's an attorney who puts her brain into good causes and her heart into dance and culture on the side. She counsels that Dungeness crab is superb, but my version with Chesapeake blues wasn't a bit bad either.  Reiko correctly describes this soup as "luscious...all it takes is money."  Serve hot as a meal to 4-6 lucky people, bread and salad on the side. </H5>
