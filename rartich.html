<HR>

<H5>It's a lovely and interesting first course, hot or cold, and goes well with chops and chicken or strong seafood.  Serve fairly generous portions to 4 people.  The soup looks lovely in flat soup plates, garnished with those savory mushrooms.</H5>

<I>Garnish:</I>  4-6 <A HREF="fmushroo.html">mushrooms</A>, thinly sliced, and

</UL>
<P>Bring stock to a boil in a large saucepan--then add artichokes, potato, onion, and seasonings.  Reduce heat, partially cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the vegetables are tender.  Puree the soup then press through a sieve, discarding solids.
<P>Meanwhile, saute mushrooms over high heat in a little butter and 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice, stirring often.  Cook until dark around the edges and concentrated--the liquid will have totally evaporated.
<P>When ready to serve, reheat the puree, stir in the cream, and bring to a simmer.  Ladle into bowls and sprinkle with mushrooms.  This soup can also be served cold.
