<HR>
<H5>This is a great soup--with a great tradition that goes with it.  During the <I>Hadj</I>--which fulfills a Moslem's fifth duty of the five pillars of Islam--many pilgrims to Mecca make a meal of this satisfying soup.  While the soup is thick, it is neither rich nor creamy--the cumin is wonderfully aromatic--and the lemon turns the meal into something quite special. Serve hot to 4 to 6 people as a substantial first course or a light meal.</H5>
