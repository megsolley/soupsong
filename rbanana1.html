<H5>I adapted this recipe from Joyce Molyneux's <I>Carved Angel Cookery Book</I>.  It's an easy and rather astonishing soup--with a warm, sunshinely color and a tropically tantalizing taste.  It is described as the best recipe of an Estonian woman who had moved all over Europe during World War II.  Flecked with splashes of heavy cream and touched up with a few scallion slices, it's a pretty soup--with a hot earthy sweetness overlaid with the tart of lemon and the spice of curry.  Absolutely outstanding as a first course to spicy barbequed chicken or pork. Serve hot to 4-6 people as a rich first course.</H5>

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat.  Stir in the onion and sweat for about 5 minutes.  Stir in the curry powder and saute for another 15 or so seconds.  Pour in the stock, bananas, lemon juice, and salt.  Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.

Puree the soup, solids first, then pour in the cream and blend.  Taste for seasoning.  Pour into bowls, flick in the cream, in an attractive pattern, and place sliced scallions.  Serve immediately.
