<P>
<BR>
Take a little backache<BR>
Melt some snow from the year of your birth<BR>
Add the lump in your throat<BR>
And the fear of the dark
<P>
Instead of oil a pinch of chill<BR>
But let it be northern<BR>
Instead of parsley<BR>
Swear loudly into it
<P>
Then stir it with the night<BR>
Until its fins and penny-nails<BR>
Are blended.<BR>
*     *     *<BR>
On what shall we cook it?
<P>
On something like a cough<BR>
On the morning star about to fade<BR>
On the whisker of a black cat<BR>
On an oval locket with a picture of Jesus<BR>
On the nipple of a sleeping woman
<P>
Let's cook it until we raise<BR>
That heavy autumnal cloud<BR>
From its bowels<BR>
Even if it takes a hundred years.
<BR>
*     *     *<BR>
What do you think it will taste like?
<P>
Like barbed wire, like burglar's tools<BR>
Like a word you'd rather forget<BR>
The way the book tastes to the goaty<BR>
Who is chewing and spitting its pages<BR>
Also like the ear of a girl you are about to undress<BR>
Also like the rim of a smile
<P>
In the twentieth century<BR>
We arouse the sun's curiosity<BR>
By whistling for the soup<BR>
To be served.<BR>
*     *     *
<BR>
What in the world shall we eat it with?
<P>
With a shoe that left last night<BR>
To baptize itself in the rain<BR>
With two eyes that quarrel in the same head<BR>
With a finger which is the divining-rod<BR>
Searching for its clearest streak<BR>
With a hat in which the thoughts<BR>
Grind each other into black pepper
<P>
We'll dive into the soup<BR>
With a grain of salt between our teeth<BR>
And won't come up<BR>
Until we learn its song.<BR>
*     *     *
<BR>
And this is what we'll have on the side:
<P>
Lust on halfshells with lemon wedges<BR>
Mushrooms stuffed with death and almonds<BR>
The bread of memory, a black bread<BR>
Blood sausages of yes and no
<P>
A hiccup in aspic with paprika<BR>
Cold wind fried in onions<BR>
A roast of darkest thoughts<BR>
Young burp with fish ears<BR>
Green apples glazed with envy
<P>
We'll wash it all down<BR>
With the ale brewed from the foam<BR>
Gathered at the mouths<BR>
Of our old pursuers:<BR>
The mad, god-sent bloodhounds.
