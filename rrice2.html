<HR>
<H5>It's really an awfully interesting soup--tangy and buttery yoghurt deeply flavored with dill and made substantial with rice.  Traditional, and obviously perfect, to break the fast at <A HREF="z71100.html">Ramadan</A> or to start the main meal after evening prayers--because it is all three stimulating, thirst quenching, and satisfying.  It's good hot--it's also good cold.  Serve it to 4-6 people as a first course to refresh and stimulate their spirits. </H5>
<HR>

<H5><UL>
<LI>1 cup uncooked <A HREF="frice.html">rice</A>, freshly cooked in 2 cups water
<LI>4 Tablespoons <A HREF="bflavor.html#butter">butter</A>
<LI>3 cups plain <A HREF="bthicken.html#dairy">yoghurt</A>
<LI>1 cup <A HREF="bstock.html#chicken stock">chicken stock</A>
<LI>1 cup water
<LI>1 large clove <A HREF="fgarlic.html">garlic</A>, pressed
<LI><A HREF="fsalt.html">salt</A> to taste
<LI>1 Tablespoon fresh <A HREF="fdill.html">dill</A> (or 1 teaspoon dried dill, pulverized)
</UL>
Cook the rice and set aside.  In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat and cook until it is just golden brown.  Stir in the yoghurt and whisk until it has incorporated the butter.  Pour in the stock and water, the pressed garlic, and salt to taste.  Whisk constantly until it is perfectly smooth.  Stir in the cooked rice and dill and let simmer to heat through.  Serve immediately, or let cool to serve at room temperature or cooler.</H5>
