<HR>
<H5>This soup was born of pure inspiration.  Zach Williams--musician, chef (self-appointed), and submarine sailor--got hungry late one night and created it out of refrigerator contents.  It's a doozie:  light and smooth with a little bite and lots of savory layers--with vegetarian and carnivorous options.  Zach lives in Virginia with his lovely wife and daring taste-tester Christina.  Many thanks to him.  Serve this hot to 6-8 people as a terrific start to a Caribbean or Mexican meal, good both hot and cold.  </H5>

In a large saucepan, saut&#233; the onion until golden.  Toss in the sliced hot pepper, then pour in the stock and bring to a boil over medium heat.  Add the sweet potatoes and thyme, reboil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
<P>
When the potatoes are cooked, puree--solids first--then pour back into the saucepan and season with salt and pepper to taste.
<P>
Hot only:  If you would like a hearty, meat soup, separately saut&#233; fresh mild sausage or saut&#233; thin rounds of a hard garlicky sausage until crisp.
<P>
When ready to serve, stir in the lemon juice then ladle the soup--either piping hot or chilled--into bowls.  Spoon in sausage, if applicable.  Top with lemon curls.
