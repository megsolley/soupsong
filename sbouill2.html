<HR>
Before your epic starts, turn to and cook<BR>
A savant stock, the Preface to your book.<BR>
And what a stock!  To baby fish and "fry"<BR>
Of scores of kinds...that morning's catch...apply<BR>
The slow, distilling heat of embers clear<BR>
And precious, spicy gravy will appear.<BR>
Steep in this sauce, with fine discrimination,<BR>
The this-and-that designed for titillation,<BR>
Manilla pepper, saffron, and bouquet!<BR>
Of fennel, with a crackling leaf of bay,<BR>
Salt, friend of man, and urchins from their bed<BR>
In warm Arenc, well-flavored and well fed.<BR>
When this great brew blows bubbles, sheds its skins,<BR>
And all is nicely done, your ode begins.
<P>
One thing is sure...this fine Phocaean dish<BR>
Is not the same without one master fish,<BR>
The vulgar hogfish, scorpion of the seas,<BR>
Which lonely on ts grill, could never please<BR>
The crudest tastes.  Yet in a bouillabaisse<BR>
It has no peer, and nothing can replace<BR>
Its subtle odors.  If, indeed, they fail,<BR>
No other art of cunning will prevail;<BR>
Hogfish alone, from chinks in shifting sand<BR>
Where bays and myrtles fringe the tenuous land<BR>
Or from some shadowed shelf of thymy cliff,<BR>
Provide such wafts for avid guests to sniff.
<P>
Next come such fish as choose a deeper stream<BR>
And hug the reefs:  fine mullet, gilthead, bream,<BR>
Saint Peter's fish. embalmers of the stew<BR>
(Such game, in fact, as greedy perch pursue).<BR>
And last, the gurnard, with Booptic eyes,<BR>
And some the ichthyologists despise,<BR>
Grand fish which Neptune, under flaming sky,<BR>
Chooses with table-forks, lays trident by.
<P>
You heedless trippers, do not judge the case<BR>
From any one-and-tuppenny bouillabaisse.<BR>
Go to the Chateau-Vert.  Say: "Something nice.<BR>
I'm not a haggler...never mind the price.<BR>
Dispatch your diver, let him burrow well<BR>
Around those rocks of heady ocean smell,<BR>
From Greece and Rome "thys" and "parangry" borrow,<BR>
And skip the cost.  We'll talk of that tomorrow."
