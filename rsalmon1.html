<H5>Total decadence--so intense, so aromatic, so beautiful in the dish--and downright aphrodisiac with all that fennel.  Why complicate it with anything more that salad, bread, and a fruit dessert?  Thanks to Jerry Newman for the inspiration. Serve hot as a meal to 4 people.</H5>

Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat, stir in the onion, fennel, and garlic, cover, and sweat the vegetables for 5 minutes.  Turn up the heat to medium and add the mushrooms, frying them for about 5 more minutes.  Then reduce the heat and stir in the flour (adding more butter, if necessary, to dissolve the flour); cook for a minute or two to lose the rawness of the flour.  Whisk in the stock, let the soup thicken a bit, then add the salmon pieces, cover, and cook for 5 minutes.  Stir in the heavy cream and bring just to a boil.  Season to taste with salt and butter.  Hold on simmer until ready to serve.
<P>
When ready to serve, stir in the cognac, ladle into large bowls, garnish with minced fennel fronds, and guiltily carry to table.
